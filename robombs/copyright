 jPCT:
  The use of jPCT is free of charge for personal and commercial use.
  Redistribution in binary form is permitted provided that the 
  following conditions are met:
 
  1. The class structure and the classes themselves as they are included
     in the JAR file that comes with this distribution of jPCT must stay intact.
     It is not allowed to decompile the class-files and/or replace the orginal
     files with modified versions until this permission is explicitly granted
     by the author.
  2. The JAR-file may be decompressed and the class-files may be stored in other 
     formats/JAR-files as long as 1.) is fulfilled. If jPCT is distributed as part
     of another project, it is allowed to obfuscate the class-files together with
     the rest of the project-files if you feel that this is required to protect 
     your intellectual property. 
  3. It is not required to mention the use of jPCT in your project, albeit it would
     be nice doing so. If you do, it is required to mention the jPCT webpage
