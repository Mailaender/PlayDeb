Description: low-level rdp emulation for mupen64plus
 N64 Reality Drawing Processor emulation which can be used with a low-level
 rsp emulation plugin like mupen64plus-rsp-z64. It can emulate even unknown or
 uncommon microcodes, but cannot benefit from faster implementation for the
 host cpu.
 .
 A fast processor and graphics hardware which supports vertex and fragment
 shader is needed for this plugin.
