              o Do not append a files suffix to a sound file name in

              o Finalized BamBam spread, removed cvar g_bambamSpread

              o Made Bambams prone to Visionless

              o Major changes to in game server browser layout: limits for
              ping colours; format changed to 'humans+bots/max'; maps not
              present locally and full slots are printed red; mods will be
              printed in cyan; added white space between 'Internet' and
              master server number; changed cvar default to hide full servers

              team change and disconnect

              o Powerups behaviour while being in the spray room

              o Re-enabled Bambam owners, Player also scores when his BamBam

              o Windows executables now properly use "%APPDATA%\Padman" as
              home path. That's the folder for screen shots, demo files etc.

        * FIXED

              o A check for multi-sample GL extension was missing

              o A few issues with LPS sounds and sorting

              o A lot of spelling mistakes

              o Always checks point limit now, regardless of active player
              number; caused very high BB scores on empty servers

              o Big Balloon capture sounds fixed so they do not play
              simultaneously

              o Bots should return the flag correctly now instead of standing
              idle in CTL

              o Bots navigation issues under ramps close to the lolly in
              CybJourney

              o Broken log file entries, replaced ancient vsprintf calls with
              more secure Q_vsnprintf

              o Dropped weapons were considered to be a weapon spawn while
              placing Boomies

              o FridgeWars sparkle shader revised and removed wrong shader
              keyword which caused error message

              o Hopefully Bambams can't be placed into brushwork any more

              o Issues with BB boxes and vertex light

              o Lagometer while demo playback is shown now correctly, taken
              from wolfcamQL

              o Last char of demo file name in menu got cut off, which caused
              loading of the demo to fail

              o Memmove for new size_t typedef, thanks to DevHC for reporting

              o Minor texture issues in Hutte, TrashMap, Jail, Anteroom,
              PadShop, Backyard

              o Moved text drop shadow for a better visibility of text on
              screen on bright background

              o Movement prediction of frozen players

              o Music play list reading from disk fixed, will now err on
              overly large files and remain silent on empty play list

              o Music was played for a second while loading a map when the
              game was unable to load the play list file

              o Padding in status command reply for long ip addresses

              o PaddyBell holds Punchy correct now

              o Players complained handicap would be set in player setup menu

              o Spray room exit portal shader issue in MopAn's Jail

              o Team overlay for spectators

        * REMOVED

              o CVAR_SERVERINFO bit mask from cvars which do not need it

              o Default game type redirect of BB-maps removed. Every map
              (bsp-file) needs it's own entry in arena file now

              o Menu options for center view, look up, look down, mouse look,
              free look, joystick, joystick threshold, always run, turn left,
              turn right, sidestep / turn

              o Outdated and not used menu entry 'sound quality' from sound
              options

              o Team and bot from status response since Players_ cvars are
              meant as a replacement

              o UDP/UDP6 net names from in game server browser info

              o Vertex lighting from menu options

        * UPDATED

              o Net protocol version number to 71. This is necessary due to
              the old clients sending quake3arena heartbeats and the master
              server not knowing the wop heartbeats.

              o WoP radiant files: CybJourney, PadShop were missing and added
              Airplane in default_shaderlist.txt; entities.def: added hints
              for RANDOMSELECT spawnflag, 'marker' to weapon entities,
              'health' and 'speed' key to loading station entity, corrected
              description of weapon and ammo 'count' default values, removed
              'model' key from 'target_balloon' entity (check XTRAS/editing
              files/WoP radiant files.zip)

              o WoP mapping files: BB sample maps because of changes in
              'target_balloon' (check XTRAS/editing files/WoP mapping
              files.zip)

              o Copyright information in copyright_en.txt and
              copyright_de.txt

              o Code base to ioquake3 revision 2140
