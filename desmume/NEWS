desmume (0.9.6-1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Users of gtk, cli and gtk-glade frontends please note that now we
    have a common directory in ~/.config/desmume for config file,
    saves and savestates. The old .desmume.ini will be moved
    automatically with the name config but you have to move your saves
    manually.

    Some save files may be invalidated due to use of broken crc logic.
    Back up your DSV files before using this version of the emulator or else
    the game might wipe it.
