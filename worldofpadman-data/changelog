              o A few issues with LPS sounds and sorting

              o A lot of spelling mistakes

              o Always checks point limit now, regardless of active player

              simultaneously

              o Bots should return the flag correctly now instead of standing

              from wolfcamQL

              o Last char of demo file name in menu got cut off, which caused

              o Minor texture issues in Hutte, TrashMap, Jail, Anteroom,
              PadShop, Backyard

              o Moved text drop shadow for a better visibility of text on
              screen on bright background

              o Movement prediction of frozen players

              o Music play list reading from disk fixed, will now err on
              overly large files and remain silent on empty play list

              o Music was played for a second while loading a map when the
              game was unable to load the play list file

              o Players complained handicap would be set in player setup menu

              o Spray room exit portal shader issue in MopAn's Jail

              o CVAR_SERVERINFO bit mask from cvars which do not need it

              o Default game type redirect of BB-maps removed. Every map
              (bsp-file) needs it's own entry in arena file now

              o Menu options for center view, look up, look down, mouse look,
              free look, joystick, joystick threshold, always run, turn left,
              turn right, sidestep / turn

              o Outdated and not used menu entry 'sound quality' from sound
              options

              o Team and bot from status response since Players_ cvars are
              meant as a replacement

              o UDP/UDP6 net names from in game server browser info

              o Vertex lighting from menu options

        * UPDATED

              o Net protocol version number to 71. This is necessary due to
              the old clients sending quake3arena heartbeats and the master
              server not knowing the wop heartbeats.

              o WoP radiant files: CybJourney, PadShop were missing and added
              Airplane in default_shaderlist.txt; entities.def: added hints
              for RANDOMSELECT spawnflag, 'marker' to weapon entities,
              'health' and 'speed' key to loading station entity, corrected
              description of weapon and ammo 'count' default values, removed
              'model' key from 'target_balloon' entity (check XTRAS/editing
              files/WoP radiant files.zip)

              o WoP mapping files: BB sample maps because of changes in
              'target_balloon' (check XTRAS/editing files/WoP mapping
              files.zip)

              o Copyright information in copyright_en.txt and
              copyright_de.txt

              o Code base to ioquake3 revision 2140
