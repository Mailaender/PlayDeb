Description: 2D space trading combat game
 NAEV is a 2D space trading and combat game, in a similar
 vein to Escape Velocity. 
 .
 NAEV is played from a top-down perspective, featuring fast-paced combat,
 many ships and outfits, and a large galaxy to explore. The game is highly
 open-ended, letting players proceed at their own paces.
