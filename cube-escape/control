Description: Progress over a maze etched on the surface of a cube
 You find yourself on the inmost level of an
 infinitely-sized cube. To escape to the next
 outer 'shell' of the cube, move across the
 surface of the inner level (including over
 cube edges) until you locate the square exit
 symbol.
