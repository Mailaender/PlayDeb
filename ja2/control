Description: Jagged Alliance 2 native Linux executable
 Arulco had been a nice, prospering country until... well,
 until Deidranna took over.
 After framing her husband prince Enrico Chivaldori for
 killing the monarch she ruled the country with an iron fist.
 Genocide, poverty and ruthless murder is common these days.
 Enrico Chivaldori gives his last dollars to a shadowy figure
 to gather a team of mercenaries to free his country.
