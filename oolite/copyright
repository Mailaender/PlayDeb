Upstream-Name: oolite
Upstream-Contact: http://www.oolite.org
Source: http://www.oolite.org.
 The upstream archive contains all dependencies needed to build the
 game and create extensions on every supported architecture. This
 results in a huge amount of precompiled binaries, free libraries
 source adapted to some specific OS, tools needed only when creating
 extensions. I removed from the source tarball all stuff not directly
 related with oolite compilation on Debian.
 .
 Removed:
 .
 Makefile, debian, tests: only used for upstream tests
 .
 Oolite.xcodeproj: concerns a Macintosh IDE.
 .
 deps: removed all but linux uncompiled dependencies.
 .
 installers/autopackage: another way of distributing on linux.
 .
 installers/win32: distribution on windows.
 .
 tools: used only by developpers.
