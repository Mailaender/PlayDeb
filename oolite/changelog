  * the game was relicensed by upstream with the dual license model (GNU GPL
    and CC-NC-SA) - this was acknowledged to be done also retroactively for
    the current stable release of the game. Here is a quote from upstream's
    announce on its forum:
    The current official release, 1.65, may be considered to be dual-licensed;
    that is, it may be distributed under its current license (the Creative
    Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 license, herafter known
    as CC-by-nc-sa-2) or the GPL.

    will be autobuild in main from now on
  * update TODO to remember to update the copyright info when the new release
    will be done
