triplea (1.6.1.4-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * Adding dotted lines to the LOTR Middle Earth map, to show connections
    over rivers. (veqryn)
    * Not showing tech in stats panel if game xml does not have any
    technologies. (veqryn)
    * Created new stepProperty, "turnSummaryPlayers", which holds a list of
    players for whom we will include their turn summary information in the
    forum/email post. (veqryn)
    * Created new stepProperty, "skipPosting", which when true will skip the
    forum posting for that EndTurn type step. (veqryn)
    * Created new xml option type "stepProperty" for a step (gamePlay -
    sequence), which can hold small options for modifying a delegate step.
    (veqryn)
    * Adding some more sounds for ancient/classical era. (veqryn)
    * Adding some more ww2 sounds and national anthems for main players.
    (hepster)
    * Allowing air movement over neutrals and enemy territories so long as
    movement over neutrals is allowed, and no nonparatrooping units are
    present. (veqryn)
    * Creating caching mechanism for sound clips, so that there are never
    more than 24 sound clips being held in memory. This should prevent errors
    in MacOS and Linux, which can not handle having large number of sound
    clips open at same time. This may however result in a delay before
    hearing clips, and still could result in errors if clips are really long.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer error for a trigger based game property change of a
    field that starts out as null. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug in strategic bombing that allowed strategic bombing of units
    that can be damaged, which were also being transported. (veqryn)
    * Adding scroll bars to notification messages window. (veqryn)
    * Increasing max memory from 640mb to 768mb, and up to 896mb for online
    games. (veqryn)
    * Moved all sounds to a specific "era" folder (ww2, preindustrial,
    classical, future) and changing how sounds are found again, so that there
    should no longer be any need for duplicate sound files. Now all sounds
    should come with TripleA, and you can use the "sounds.properties" file to
    cherry pick which sounds you want. (veqryn)
    * Created a "sounds.properties" file which allows you to specify which
    era of sounds (ww2, preindustrial, classical, future) you are using, and
    also set up custom sound choices for each sound location path. (veqryn)
    * Getting TripleA Map Panel to center on the capital of a player,
    whenever we switch to a new player's phase. (veqryn)
    * Changing getBoundingRect and createTerritoryImage and getTiles so that
    any polygons on the right or bottom will be translated to be on the
    negative left or top, hopefully solving issue where the mini territory
    image was not being displayed properly for territories on both sides of a
    map divide. (frigoref) 
    * Abstracting the Stats panels into AbstractStatPanel so that extending
    Stats panel (and all of its overhead) is no longer necessary for the
    EconomyPanel, ObjectivePanel, TerritoryDetailPanel, and other panels.
    (veqryn)
    * Changing Tech Stats Panel to use small flag images for column headers
    instead of the first letter of nation names. (veqryn)
    * Fixing bugs with placing constructions in sea zones. Now constructions
    can only be "produced" by the territory they are going into. (veqryn)
    * Adding a lot more sounds to the engine (zim xero) and some sounds
    specific to napoleonic empires. (hepster & veqryn)
    * Added tutorial on how to make a map and/or map skin. (veqryn)
    * Allowing for Sea Factories, and Air Factories, to produce from owned
    sea zones. (veqryn)
    * Added UPnP support to TripleA, so that TripleA will now attempt to
    Forward Ports for the user.  This means users should no longer have to do
    port forwarding themselves to be able to host a game online. (veqryn)
    * Created framework for using UPnP library, and UI component for user.
    (veqryn)
    * Added java library for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to TripleA.
    (veqryn)
    * Created new HotKey, "N", which when pressed during a movement phase,
    will cycle through all units with available movement left, focusing the
    map on the unit. (veqryn)
    * Created new HotKey, "I", which when pressed will create a popup for 5
    seconds showing all the info about the unit and/or territory your mouse
    is currently over. (veqryn)
    * Allowing the map to be scrolled by using the arrow keys and/or WASD.
    (veqryn)
    * Added original owner, whenCapturedByGoesTo, captureUnitOnEnteringBy,
    and changeUnitOwners to the Territory tooltip and territory tab info.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixing Move Panel and Place Panel so that Undoing a move or place will
    not result in scrolling back to the top, and will instead scroll to make
    sure that the move under the undoed move is still visible. (veqryn)
    * Allowing all sounds to have a player associated with them.  Just name
    the sound "<soundName>_<playerName>".  If the player sound does not
    exist, it will use the default non-player sound. (veqryn)
    * Added a ton more new sounds to the engine. (veqryn)
    * Changed Sounds so that instead of specific sound files, the engine will
    search for specific sound folder. The engine will then randomly select a
    sound in that folder and play it. This allows for randomized sounds.
    (veqryn)
    * Made sure any clicking or dragging gives focus to the main map panel
    area. Also ensuring that if focus goes to the tabs panel tabs, that the
    focus goes back to the map. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option property, "Submarines Defending May Submerge Or
    Retreat", which will allow defending submarines to submerge or retreat to
    a friendly neighboring sea zone. (veqryn)
    * Deleting game option property, "Hari-Kari Units", since it doesn't do
    anything at this point. (veqryn)
    * Deleting game option property, "Previous Units Fight", since it doesn't
    do anything at this point. (veqryn)
    * Allowing sea units to retreat back if the retreating to territory
    contains only ignored enemy units. (veqryn) 
    * Disallowing rockets from firing over impassible territories by default.
    (veqryn)
    * Added message on how long a ban lasts for, when a user tries to
    reconnect to the lobby. (veqryn)
    * Created ui wrapper for properties, and allowed most to be editable.
    (veqryn)
    * Created new map utility, "MapPropertiesMaker", which will make the
    "map.properties" file. (veqryn)
    * Added an 'Is Amphibious' check box to the battle calculator, so that
    units like marines will correctly calculate for an amphibious battle.
    (veqryn)
    * Getting Decoration Placer to auto place all images nicely on the map if
    they match the territory names or if they are not decorations. Also
    including detailed instructions. (veqryn)
    * Got the Decoration Placer to work with placing PUs, decorations, name
    images, capitals, vc's, and all other image types and text files.
    (veqryn)
    * Creating new map utility, "Decoration Placer", which allows a map maker
    to put decorations and other images on a map, recording their points in a
    text file. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug in Triggers that use "chance" and also have more than 1
    action or event inside them, so that they will no longer test once for
    each action, and instead only one time total. (veqryn)
    * Created new tab, "Notes", which will just show the game notes, on the
    right side of the screen. (veqryn)
    * Getting the objective panel to not refresh more than every 10 seconds,
    and adding a "Refresh" button so that it can be manually refreshed.
    (veqryn)
    * Getting the objectives on the objective tab to show up in colors (red =
    true, blue = used up), and show more information: <#of uses
    left><T=true/F=false><#of objectives filled>. (veqryn)
    * Including on Objective tab whether condition is currently true or not,
    and getting it to update with the game. (veqryn)
    * Creating new text file, "objectives.properties", which will hold all
    the details about what objectives to show on the objective tab. (veqryn)
    * Creating new stats panel, "Objective" Tab, which will contain a list of
    all national objectives and any other conditions the map maker wants.
    (veqryn)
    * Created new "map.properties" variables: "map.cursor.hotspot.x", and
    "map.cursor.hotspot.y". (veqryn)
    * Allowing TripleA to use custom cursors located at "misc/cursor.gif".
    (veqryn)
    * Getting TripleA to use any sounds located in a folder named "sounds" in
    any map file, thereby allowing custom sounds for every map. (veqryn)
    * Renaming the "images" folder into "assets", and then moving the
    "sounds" folder to be inside of the "assets" folder, inside the triplea
    program directory. (veqryn)
    * Created new text file, "comments.txt", which will control where things
    like convoy route names and comments will go. (veqryn)
    * Deleted "map.properties" variable "map.showConvoyNames" and replaced
    with "map.showComments". (veqryn)
    * Created new folder, "territoryNames", which can be filled with .png
    images of each territory name. These will be displayed at the points in
    "name_place.txt". (veqryn)
    * Created new "map.properties" variables: "units.stack.size",
    "map.showSeaZoneNames", and "map.drawNamesFromTopLeft". (veqryn)
    * Deleting xml property, "Display Sea Names", and will replace it with a
    map.properties property "map.showSeaZoneNames", because display options
    should not be in the xml, only game logic should be. (veqryn)
    * Deleting xml property, "Display Units as Counters", and will replace it
    with a map.properties property "units.stack.size", because display
    options should not be in the xml, only game logic should be. (veqryn)
    * Created new "map.properties" variable "map.scrollWrapY", and got
    TripleA to successfully scroll in the Y direction, as well as both X and
    Y at the same time seamlessly. (veqryn & frigoref)
    * Created new "map.properties" variables: "map.showResources", and
    "screenshot.title.enabled". (veqryn)
    * Creating a ConnectionFinder for the 'map' part of the xml. (edwin van
    der wal)
    * Adding Mnemonics to menu options in game. (frigoref)

    * Set up UI for map creator, fixed it up to be able to run all utility
    files, including sending arguments to them. (veqryn)
    * Creating a new Map Creator / Map Maker that is accessible from the
    Engine Preferences section of TripleA. (veqryn)

    * Preventing fighters that used up all movement to get to a battle, from
    getting to retreat. (veqryn)
    * Allowing PlacementPicker and AutoPlacementFinder to accept two
    arguments (when run by command line), the width and the height, of the
    placements. (veqryn)
    * Fixed issues preventing the smallMap from being updated after switching
    map skins. Also polishing up support for map skins that are totally
    different than the original map. (veqryn)
    * Creating new "map.properties" variables: "units.width", "units.height",
    "units.counter.offset.width" and "units.counter.offset.height", allowing
    maps to use non-standard sized unit images. (veqryn)
    * Fixing a bug in center picker, and fixing a bug where selecting a map
    skin didn't verify the map before changing the user preferences. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug where rockets could attack a factory multiple times. (veqryn)
    * Deleting the game option "Rocket Attack Per Factory Restricted", and
    replacing it with its inverse, "Rocket Attacks Per Factory Infinite".
    (veqryn)
    * Fixed issue with not being Java 1.5 compatible. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer error in getSkins method when user has installed
    triplea to the user folder. (veqryn)

    player's node while in the History mode, which showed the current
    player's territory summary instead of the selected player. (veqryn)
    * Fixing movement validation bug that disallowed movement into a sea zone
    controlled by the enemy with subs, if the sea zone also had an owner,
    even if subs are being ignored. (veqryn)
    * Adding new AI, "Moore N Able (2)", with ability to read a script file
    from map folder. (kmoore)
    * Fixing Concurrent Modification error with getIsAmphibiousMarine method
    in battle display. (veqryn)
    * Fixing comparison method in Easy AI (weak ai) so that adheres to the
    comparison contract. Also cleaned up a lot of code, fixed a lot of
    warnings. (veqryn)
    * Fixing bug history panel bug caused by loading a savegame at the end of
    the last player's turn, causing a "Can not add event, not in step" error
    to be thrown. (veqryn)
    * Adding new menu option "Focus On Own Casualties", which when selected
    will cause the default casualty selection to focused, allowing the user
    to hit spacebar to accept it. (hakon)
    * Changed order of steps so that in games where Submarines may submerge
    before battle, the attacker is asked first, then the defender is asked.
    (hakon)
    * Showed convoy blockade dice rolls in History Panel even if the blockade
    damage is zero. (veqryn)

    * Fixed bug in Paratroopers code, causing paratrooper attacks in coast
    territories on maps with scrambling to never actually take the territory.
    (veqryn)
    * Creating a simple Ping method inside of the Chat Controller, that will
    ping all computers once every minute, hopefully improving everyone's
    connections. (Sean Bridges & veqryn)
    * Allowing people to hold SHIFT down while their mouse is over a
    territory in order to keep that territory in the Territory Panel, no
    matter where they move their mouse afterwards. (frigoref)
    * Changed EndTurnDelegate so that Units Changing Ownership, and Hitpoint
    Repair, will still happen even if you have lost your capital. (veqryn)
    * Getting MooreAI to submerge subs if only enemy air is left. (hakon)
    * Fixing "Edit Unit Bombing Damage" for maps that use territory based
    damage, such as ww2v3. (veqryn)

    * Improved bombing result display to show ignored dice if there are any,
    and improving history panel to show the rolls for each target unit.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixed integer array error in Strategy Bombing with Heavy Bombers,
    causing the second half of all rolls to not be rolled, thereby defaulting
    to one each. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer for undoing a placement made by UK in global 1940
    maps, caused by the new no-air-checking delegate [players will need to
    update their 1940 maps though]. (veqryn)
    * Creating framework for TripleA to use proxies to connect to the
    internet. Allowing map downloading, PBEM/PBF, and dice servers to use a
    proxy. (veqryn)
    * Improving "Draw Territory Borders On Top" so that it will automatically
    switch to "medium" if you are on "low/default" and are zooming, and
    switch back once you stop zooming out. (veqryn)
    * Changing lobby moderator ban/mute options to make more sense, by only
    giving 3 options: name only, everything, or cancel. (veqryn) 
    * Adding a backup lobby properties location on the tripleawarclub, in
    addition to the one on sourceforge. (veqryn)

    the most powerful aa gun in the group. (veqryn)
    * Fixed some math bugs in low luck picking of aa casualties for maps with
    non-standard aa guns. (veqryn)
    * Made massive updates to 1.5.2.1 and 1.6 so that they can work as 'old'
    jars and be run from 1.6.1.1 or future versions. (veqryn)
    * Disallowing starting of games if game data is null. (veqryn)
    * Allowing hosts to load an old savegame, causing old engine to join
    lobby and host directly, if they have the jar to run it. (veqryn)
    * Allowing members in online lobby to join games hosted by older versions
    of triplea, if they have the jar to run it. (veqryn)
    * Adding game version (GV), and engine version (EV), columns to lobby.

    * Fixing movement validation to allow submarines that are transports to
    carry land units through other ships. (veqryn)

    lines. (veqryn)
    * Fixing bug preventing renamed hardcoded techs from working properly.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixing some errors with Sliding Tiles game, Tic Tac Toe, and Kings

    forced them to shorten for the history event record, to 150 characters if
    needed by removing all html code then truncating the string. (veqryn)
    * Fixed issue with moving of old fighters to a new carrier by making sure
    it only used the producer territory. (veqryn)

    (veqryn)
    * Created dialog to ask user if they want to load an old savegame.  Fixed
    framework so that it can load any old savegame if it can find an old
    engine to match. And added 1.6.0.0 jar engine. (veqryn)

 -- Christoph Korn <christoph.korn@getdeb.net>  Sat, 29 Sep 2012 21:25:53 +0200

triplea (1.6.1.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * Rewriting build file and including META-INF, hopefully fixing issue
    with Gmail play-by-email emailer on linux machines. (rain)
    * Changing trigger property changes to use "-reset-" instead of clear.
    Can now be used with any attachment option. (veqryn)
    * Creating a reset method for every single attachment property. These can
    now be used to return a property to its default value. (veqryn)
    * Fixing some bugs introduced into AI with the factory switch. (veqryn)
    * Fixing null pointer error in Easy AI purchasing algorithm for getting
    costs of units. (veqryn)
    * Changing maxDamage to default to 2 instead of -1. This is for bombing
    type damage, and it acts as either a multiplier of territory value or as
    a hard set number depending on canProduceXUnits. (veqryn)
    * Fixing AIs to no longer use isFactory, and instead use things like
    canProduceUnits, etc. (veqryn)
    * Abstracting isFactory setting and matches to use the component parts.
    (veqryn)
    * Deleting unit attachment, "isFactory", but keeping the setter so that
    old xml's will not break. 
        setting isFactory now just sets: canBeDamaged, isInfrastructure,
        canProduceUnits, isConstruction, constructionType = "factory",
        maxConstructionsPerTypePerTerr = 1,
        constructionsPerTerrPerTypePerTurn = 1. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Submarines Prevent Unescorted Amphibious
    Assaults", that prevent unescorted transports from conducting amphibious
    assaults. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Kamikaze Suicide Attacks Only Where Battles
    Are", and implemented it. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug where land units would disappear when conquering a sea zone.
    (veqryn)
    * Making kamikaze and interceptor dialogs non-modal so user can move
    around map while choosing. Again, saving during the dialog then reloading
    might have odd effects. (veqryn)
    * Making scramble dialog non-modal so that the user can move the map
    around before choosing what to scramble. Note that saving the game while
    in the middle of scrambling can result in weird effects, so it is not
    recommended. (veqryn)
    * Undoing update to java Substance 7.1, in order to maintain
    compatibility with Java 5. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit bombing damage on any
    and all units which can be damaged by bombing. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit hitpoint damage on any
    and all units which can take more than 1 point of hit damage. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to remove technology from a player, except that
    shipyards and industrial technology can never be removed, and any
    technology that uses triggers is pointless to remove and removing will
    not undo their effect. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to add technology to a player. (veqryn)
    * Adding methods to ensure that any power sharing technology (like
    British to UK Pacific) will still roll for war bonds even if its capital
    is taken, so long as the shared power is not able to have the warbonds
    technologies. (veqryn)
    * Allowing additional nations to share the cost of technology, and
    creating a good user interface that dynamically adjusts to show how much
    is being paid by each nation. (veqryn)
    * Created an option in Play-By-Forum and Play-By-Email to send the move
    summary after the combat move phase, in addition to the summary at the
    end of the turn. This is to help with OOL and scrambling orders. (veqryn)
    * Abstracted EndTurnPanel into AbstractForumPosterPanel, then created
    MoveForumPosterPanel. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Remove All Tech Tokens At End Of Turn", which
    will remove tech tokens after each tech roll. (veqryn)
    * Make savegames for long games, games with many players, and games with
    many battles, much smaller. (veqryn)
    * Changing how Battle Records get added and removed from game data
