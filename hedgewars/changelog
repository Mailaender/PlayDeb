hedgewars (0.9.20.5-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (LP: #1280796)
    + New campaign, A Space Adventure!
    + Password protected rooms
    + Shapes on drawn maps (ellipses, rectangles)  - constrain dimensions
    with ctrl, as with straight line tool.
    + New rubber utility, lfBouncy mask (green) for maps.  lfBouncy is also
    anti-portal.
    + Lazy loading of many aspects of frontend to improve startup time under
    Windows
    + Set hog/team/health label defaults in config, toggle team health
    display using delete (left shift + delete for labels now)
    + Usernames next to teams when playing online.
    + Can now filter rooms by game style (such as Highlander). Filtering
    simplified since it is mostly unused.
    + AFK mode.  Press p when not your turn online to trigger autoskip of
    your turn.
    + Russian localisation of Default voice.
    + Map edges can wrap or bounce.  Also a silly "connect to the sea" mode
    + Sticky fire kicks you a bit less, fire interacts with frozen land/ice
    + Generated map stays same if the template is the same between groups
    (all/large for example)
    + Visual enhancements for whip and crosshair
    + Option to draw maps with a "shoppa" border - used by ShoppaMap lua at
    present
    + New hats
    + Translation updates
    + New lua script to control gravity.  May have unpredictable effects. 
    Try zero g shoppa.  Changes to allow lua to spawn poison clouds without
    interrupting turn.
    + Speech bubbles are now echoed to chat for logging purposes with the
    hog's name.
    * You should now thaw on your turn, not enemy's. AI frozen/unfrozen crate
    movement fix. Blowtorch can thaw frozen hogs.
    * Prevent target crosshair moving around unpredictably when doing
    multiple airstrikes
    * Rope should kick along surfaces more reliably, fix rope aim speed if
    you miss a shot, firing rope does not freeze timer, fix aiming on last
    rope
    * Remember bounce/timer in reset wep modes like Highlander
    * Increase precision in damage calcs; extra damage affects fire properly
    now
    * Fixed video recording resolution
    * Fixed context menu/cursor in text areas
    * Many bugfixes. Keypad enter in chat, hog sliding freezing game, team
    name flaws in Windows, localisation of tips, crasher in slots with no
    weapons, frontend holiday css.

hedgewars (0.9.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + New theme: Fruit
    + Cool New Weapons: Freezer
    + We've improved your existing arsenal, too! The 'size' of cleaver has been
      reduced, so now it's more likely to cut into hogs instead of imbedding
      itself infuriatingly into the ground. The Flying Saucer has also seen some
      interesting changes...
    + Death comes from below!
      It's time to take your amphibious assault to the next level.
      While using the Flying Saucer, it's now possible to launch projectiles
      from underwater!
      Also, instead of just dropping bombs on your enemies you can aim
      them, too! Wow!
    + Improved AI
      The newly improved AI can use drill-rockets!
    + New Gameplay Challenges
      A frenetic, awesome new gameplay mode: Frenzy! In this mode each turn
      lasts only one second.
    + An extra mission: Nobody Laugh.
    + More Achievements: 'Prestigious Pilot' and 'Naughty Ninja' have been added
      to the old missions. Have fun trying to unlock them.
    + A new weaponset, One of Everything.
    + New Maps
      Fight on a variety of new battlegrounds!
      New entries include Bones, Crystal, Grassy, Haunty, Oaks,
      Shrooms and Tentacles!
    + More customization!
      Over 30 new hats!
      New SteelTower fort!
    + Ropers Rejoice
      Now you can play on an 'infinite' number of procedurally generated maps,
      thanks to the new Shoppa Map script.
    + Much improvements in the behavior of rope in 0.9.18.
  * Dropped patch for ghc 7.6 build failure.

hedgewars (0.9.18-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * New upstream version (Closes: #691986 LP: #1073730)
    + Built using the -3 upstream tarball hedgewars-src-0.9.18-3.tar.bz2
    + Hedgewars now has a campaign! This was a GSoC project.
    + Another GSoC project, video recording! Use the 'r' key to start/stop
      recording video. Video management is on the frontpage.
    + PNG screenshots, to make sharing screenshots more convenient.
    + New weapons! The meat cleaver is the latest addition.
      Cleavers work well for climbing or blocking entrances.
    + The AI is now a lot more evil. Set it to maximum level to get the full
      effect. It knows how to use cake, sniper rifle and kamikaze, as well
      as aiming shots to drown hedgehogs or do fall damage. It has also gotten
      more effective at a number of existing weapons, and can move around the
      map more intelligently.
    + Drawn maps now have variable pen width, and an eraser tool.
      Note that the eraser does increase the size of the drawn map network
      traffic, so don't use it as a substitute for undo.
    + Static maps no longer have size limits. Please use this sanely, since not
      everyone has a machine with 16 gigs of memory like you do.
    + New missions such as portal and rope training.
    + Customised team colours! Check the advanced tab in team config.
    + Individual hog health now shows up in the team health bar.
    + Some weapon tweaks, such as throwing things from rope varying based on
      density (similar to More Wind) mode, drill rocket no longer exploding
      in your face if fired from against a wall, you are now able to rope through
      a portal or fly an RC plane through one, and multiple portal pairs can be
      setup in a turn by a team if you switch hogs.
    + Bugfixes Bugfixes Bugfixes (okandprobablyaddedmorebugstoo) and performance
      enhancements like reduced memory usage.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.4
  * Added some external build-dependencies

     so remember to check it from time to time. If you decide you want
     to go back to standard Hedgewars, just remove the Data directory
     from your Hedgewars config directory.
   + 3-D rendering! Diorama-like rendering of the game in a variety
     of 3D modes. Let us know which ones work best for you, we didn't
     really have the equipment to test them all.
   + Resizable game window.
   + New utilities! The Time Box will remove one of your hedgehogs
     from the game for a while, protecting from attack until it returns,
     somewhere else on the map. Land spray will allow you to build bridges,
     seal up holes, or just make life unpleasant for your enemies.
   + New single player: Bamboo Thicket, That Sinking Feeling, Newton and
     the Tree and multi-player: The Specialists, Space Invaders,
     Racer - scripts! And a ton more script hooks for scripters
   + New twists on old weapons. Drill strike, seduction and fire have
     been adjusted. Defective mines have been added, rope can attach to
     hogs/crates/barrels again, grenades now have variable bounce (use
     precise key + 1-5). Portal gun is now more usable in flight and
     all game actions are a lot faster.

     localised Default voice, Ukranian.
