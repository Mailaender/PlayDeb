Note that an embedded copy of libjpeg is used when building UrbanTerror.
This is due to upstream shipping with this embedded and outdated version,
and the difficulties encountered when trying to patch to use the system 
libjpeg (Graphical corruption, and extremely low framerates).

Source package tremulous has this same issue, it could probably be resolved
with sufficient time, but it is not currently a priority.
