mupen64plus (1.99.4+1) unstable; urgency=low

  mupen64plus was converted from a complete monolithic emulator to a modular
  architecture [1] to create a more portable core. Therefore, the core is now a
  library and not a GUI with included emulation cores. The mupen64plus
  distribution only provides some basic plugins, a reference console frontend
  and the core library.

  Additional third party frontends [2] are necessary to get a GUI or special
  functionality like configuration dialogs. Otherwise the new configuration
  registry file "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/mupen64plus.cfg has to be edited by hand
  to change the settings.

  The input plugin provides an auto-configuration of input devices to help the
  users getting their joysticks and gamepads to work without editing the
  configuration registry. Many joysticks aren't known yet, but it is still
  possible to change the settings manually [3]. It is recommended to forward
  the new settings to the mupen64plus developers to get them included in future
  releases.

  Old settings aren't converted to the new configuration registry, but old
  savestates from mupen64plus >= 1.5+dfsg1-2 should work without any problems.
  Pre-2.0 plugins aren't supported by the emulation core due to a complete
  changed plugin api.

mupen64plus (1.5+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The used paths in which mupen64plus saves its data for every user was
  changed to be compliant to the XDG Base Directory Specification[1].

  To use the previously generated configuration and data files, they must be
  moved to the new directories. mupen64plus.conf has to be adjusted slightly
  to point to find the new directory to save the rombrowser cache.
  This can be done in some simple steps, but be sure that you have a backup
  of the files inside $HOME/.mupen64plus

  # mkdir -p "$HOME"/.config/mupen64plus/
  # mkdir -p "$HOME"/.local/share/mupen64plus/
  # mkdir -p "$HOME"/.cache/mupen64plus/
  # mv "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/*.conf "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/*.cfg \
       "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/*.ini "$HOME"/.config/mupen64plus/
  # mv "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/save "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/screenshots \
       "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/hires_texture "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/texture_dump \
       "$HOME"/.local/share/mupen64plus/
  # mv "$HOME"/.mupen64plus/rombrowser.cache "$HOME"/.cache/mupen64plus/
  # sed -i "s/.*RomCacheFile\\s*=.*//" \
           "$HOME"/.config/mupen64plus/mupen64plus.conf
