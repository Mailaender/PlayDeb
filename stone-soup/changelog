stone-soup (0.11.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    0.11 Highlights
    ----------

    * Removed monsters: Jozef, bog mummy, midge, Pit Fiend, hairy devil.
    * Lots of new vaults and tiles.
    * Config file overhaul: lists require += when appending, you don't need
    to upgrade your config by hand anymore (after this last(?) time).

    Branches, environment
    ---------------------
    * New wizlab: Roulette of Golubria.
    * A metric buttload of new vaults, including several new branch endings
    and a full-level vault for deeper parts of the main dungeon.

    * There are three new level layouts for the dungeon and various branches.
    * You don't lose portal vaults after being banished from one.

    and more trees. It is also less misty than before.
    * Swamp trees are now mangroves, and are opaque.
    * Spider Nest: replaces the old spider portal vault, contains the
    gossamer rune of Zot.
    * Games will have one of the Spider Nest or Snake Pit, and one of the
    Swamp or
