Description: Object-oriented Graphics Rendering Engine (development files)
 Ogre is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed
 to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications
 utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all
 the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and
 OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive
 classes.
 .
 This package contains the headers needed to develop with Ogre.
