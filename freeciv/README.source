Source notes for freeciv in Debian
==================================

Bugs in ggz.m4 have made necessary adding a patch that modified the
m4 and refreshed parts of the automake files. In 2.1.5, the following was
done to get a working patch:

 - forwardport ggz.m4 bits from the previous upstream release.
 - refresh configure issuing:
     aclocal -I m4
     autoconf
   and generating a diff of the results.
