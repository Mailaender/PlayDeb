* consider switching build system to build all clients at once
* investigate dpkg-shlibdeps and its whinging
* switch to dpkg-maintscript-helper if someone can make it work.
eg:

if [ -x `which dpkg-maintscript-helper` ]; then
#    If freeciv is being removed, this file is no longer needed. Unfortunately,
#    the packaging doesn't appear to make the file. I haven't worked out where
#    it is from yet though.
    dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile /etc/ggz.modules 2.2.2-1 -- "$@"
#    Were these two files moved, or just the client files? I can't work out
#    what creates these two.
    dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile /etc/ggzd/games/civserver.dsc \
    2.1.1-1 -- "$@"
    dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile /etc/ggzd/rooms/civserver.room \
    2.1.1-1 -- "$@"
fi
