    LICENSE NOTES
    =============
    The license covers the source code found in the "src" directory of this
    archive as well as the .cfg files under the "data" directory. The included 
    ENet network library which Sauerbraten uses is covered by an MIT-style 
    license, which is however compatible with the above license for all 
    practical purposes.

    Game media included in the game (maps, textures, sounds, models etc.)
    are NOT covered by this license, and may have individual copyrights and
    distribution restrictions (see individual readmes).
