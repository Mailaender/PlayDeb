  * New upstream version (LP: #726238)
    SuperTuxKart 0.7 (December 2010)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Too many to list them all. Main points:
    * Irrlicht:
      - Ported from plib to irrlicht
      - Added animations to karts and some tracks
    * GUI
      - Completely new designed GUI
    * Other improvements
      - Allowed alternative ways/shortcuts in tracks
      - New item 'switch'
    * New art:
      - New tracks farm, hacienda, scotland, secret garden

    SuperTuxKart 0.6.2a (October 2009)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Bugfix: STK would crash while trying to save the config file
              on Windows Vista.

    SuperTuxKart 0.6.2 (July 2009)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Bugfix: Game could crash in rare circumstances.

              not subtract already allocated points.
    * Bugfix: A race could be finished with an invalid shortcut.

    * Bugfix: GP result showed kart identifier instead of name.
    * Improvement: there is now 1 1 sec. wait period for the race
              result screen, avoiding the problem that someone

              quitting the menu before it can be read.
