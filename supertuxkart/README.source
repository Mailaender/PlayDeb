As of SuperTuxKart version 0.8, upstream developers have embedded a forked copy
of Irrlicht into STK, which is now being used by this Debian package (as of
0.8-1, when build-depends on libirrlicht-dev was dropped). Rationale is as
follows:

 - Upstream STK devs have made modifications to Irrlicht that they deem
   necessary for STK, which upstream Irrlicht has rejected [1]. Furthermore,
   in the future, STK devs plan on making more intrusive changes to Irrlicht,
   which may break the API [2].
 - Past attempts to use Debian's version of Irrlicht in STK has been extremely
   troublesome due to upstream STK's usage of unreleased svn revisions of
   Irrlicht (e.g. Irrlicht r3843 for STK 0.7.3). Although I have tried to
   patch STK to use a system copy of Irrlicht in the past [3], this has caused
   a number of rendering bugs (e.g. [4]) and a large number of semi-random
   segfaults (e.g. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]...), and is simply infeasible now
   that upstream STK devs plan on making more intrusive changes to Irrlicht.

Note that the embedded copy of Irrlicht is built with Debian's zlib/bzip2/
libpng/libjpeg/glext instead of the embedded copies within the Irrlicht source
code (which should address security concerns relating to embedding Irrlicht).

If interested, a more thorough discussion on this topic can be reviewed on
debian-devel-games, in this thread [12] (starting with [13]).
