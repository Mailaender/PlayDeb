Description: Real-time strategy game of ancient warfare
 0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
 real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a

 the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C.
 and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D
 graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built
 game engine.
