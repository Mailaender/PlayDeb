    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
    claims:
 .
     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
        modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
        Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
        as part of a Larger Work; and
     b. under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
        Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer
        for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or
        portions thereof).
     c. the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are
        effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
        Original Code under the terms of this License.
     d. Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is
        granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
        separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused
        by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
        combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
 .
    2.2. Contributor Grant.
 .
    Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
 .
     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
        display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications

        unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/
        or as part of a Larger Work; and
     b. under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
        Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
        combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
        combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/
        or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
        Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
        Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
        Version (or portions of such combination).
     c. the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are
        effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
        the Covered Code.
     d. Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is
        granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
        Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3)
        for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
        Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made
        by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the
        Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
        infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
        that Contributor.
 .
    3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
    3.1. Application of License.
 .
    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
    an additional document offering the additional rights described in
    Section 3.5.
 .
    3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 .
    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
    either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
    Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
    (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least
    six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
    Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
    responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
    by a third party.
 .
    3.3. Description of Modifications.
 .
    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
    the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
    the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
    Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
    Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
    Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
    origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
    (a) Third Party Claims
 .
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
    intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
    must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
    "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
    sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
    Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
    available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
    modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
    thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
    mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those
    who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
    (b) Contributor APIs
 .
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
    interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
    reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
    include this information in the legal file.
 .
    (c) Representations.
 .
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
    3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
    are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
    sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 .
    3.5. Required Notices.
 .
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
    Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
    Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in
    a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be
    likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
    Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
    described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
    documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
    rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose
    to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
    clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
    the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for
    that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
    Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
    of this License, including a description of how and where You have
    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
    related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
    rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
    Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
    license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
    License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
    License and that the license for the Executable version does not
    attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
    version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
    the Executable version under a different license You must make it
    absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
    offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
    or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
    3.7. Larger Works.
 .
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must
    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.
 .
    5. Application of this License.
 .
    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
    6. Versions of the License.
 .
    6.1. New Versions
 .
    Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
    and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
    6.2. Effect of New Versions
 .
    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
    terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
    No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
    applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
 .
    6.3. Derivative Works
 .
    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
    Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
    that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
    "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
    (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
    otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains
    terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape
    Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
    Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
    shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
    License.)
 .
    7. Disclaimer of warranty
 .
    Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,
    without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including,
    without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of
    defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
    non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
    the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective
    in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any other
    contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or
    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
    of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder
    except under this disclaimer.
 .
    8. Termination
 .
    8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
    survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
    shall survive.
 .
    8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
    claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial
    Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
    against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
    alleging that:
 .
     a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
        Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
        shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
        prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
        You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
        agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
        Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
        litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
        such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
        royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
        writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
        the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/
        or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
        notice period specified above.
     b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
        Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
        then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
        2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first
        made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
        that Participant.
 .
    8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.
 .
    8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
    which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
    prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
    9. Limitation of liability
 .
    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the
    initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
    covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to
    any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
    damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for
    loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
    any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
    shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
    limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
    personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
    applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
    allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.
 .
    10. U.S. government end users
 .
    The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
    terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
    those rights set forth herein.
 .
    11. Miscellaneous
 .
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
    License.
 .
    12. Responsibility for claims
 .
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
    13. Multiple-licensed code
 .
    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
    "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
    Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
    by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
