Description: NScripter-style novel-game interpreter
 Ponscripter is an NScripter-style novel-game interpreter with an
 emphasis on supporting games in Western languages.  The goal is to
 provide an easy porting target for translation projects.
 .
 Ponscripter deliberately breaks compatibility with ONScripter.  For
 example, it is sometimes able to read ONScripter saved games, but
 ONScripter will almost never be able to read Ponscripter saved games.
