.SH DESCRIPTION
Vulture 2.2.100 is an enhanced, highly graphical window port (user

game while keeping the original gameplay of SLASH'em.

Here's a brief list of features:

High-res, 32-bit isometric graphics with real-time lighting 

Customizable digitized sound effects 

Symphonic soundtracks

Mouse-driven interface (keyboard play also works)
