unvanquished (0.4.0-1~debian.sid) unstable; urgency=low

  If you're upgrading from 0.3.5 or older or you have Unvanquished
  configuration files in your home directory, you're likely to need at least
  one of the following.

  * Parser changes mean that 'bind \ foo' won't work.

    You'll have to change such bindings to 'bind BACKSLASH foo'. These are
    normally found in ~/.Unvanquished/main/autogen.cfg, but may be found
    elsewhere.

    The following command will fix them up.

      $ sed -i -e 's/^bind \\/bind BACKSLASH/' ~/.Unvanquished/*/*.cfg

  * Connection to servers will fail.

    Easy to solve, and there are (at least) two easy ways to fix it:

      $ unvanquished +reset protocol

      Press ` (backquote) then type “/reset protocol”

  With these done, all should be well...
