    --- Gameplay ---
    * Added: Radiators and other "edge tile" objects now occupy just one edge
    of the tile, inline with the original game. As a result one tile
    corridors can now be heated properly. An addition is that you can place
    many such objects on a single tile as long as they face different
    directions.
    * Added: Possibility to play movies in-game. At the moment the intro
    movie, advancement between levels and the win/lose movies has been added.
    * Added: The atom analyzer can now be built in the research department if
    it is available on the map.
    * Added: User actions are no longer allowed by default (for new games)
    when the game is paused. When trying this it might seem like it doesn't
    work correctly, but we try to mimic the original as much as possible.
    This for example means that a staff member being placed as you pause
    will disappear from the cursor. We might change this behaviour in the
    future though.
    * Added: Some background sounds, coughs, phones ringing etc. 
    * Change: Placing a member of staff inside a room that is already
    occupied will now replace that person.
    * Fix: Earthquakes could be four times as severe as intended. Still todo:
      A tremor before a coming big earthquake.
    * Fix: Crashes in certain situations involving receptionists and
    reception desks.
    * Fix: Patients being handled at a reception desk even if no receptionist
      is present.
    * Fix: Allow patients to be sent to the research room only if the
    corresponding room is not yet researched (so not if it is researched but
    not built).
    * Fix: Don't cancel a place staff action just because the player happens
    to click on a door.
    * Fix: The VIP would try to sit down if there was a queue for the
    reception desk. The VIP will no longer ever try to sit down, and he will
    have priority in the queue anyway.
    * Fix: If a member of staff was done resting at the same time as he/she
    was also finished using the pool table or the video game another object
    in the room could get reserved indefinitely.

    --- User Interface ---
    * Added: You can now see in the bank statement which drug company a
    certain drug was bought from. It has no effect on gameplay though.
    * Added: The adviser now tells you why the research screen can't be
    opened before you have built a research department.
    * Added: The Town Map functionality has been extended inline with Theme
      Hospital. For example, if you right-click somewhere in your hospital
      the view will be moved there.
    * Added: Available options on open faxes now gets updated if for example
    a room explodes or the player builds a research department.
    * Added: Keyboard shortcuts F1 - F9 for the fullscreen windows. They are
    NOT the same as in original TH but instead correspond to the order on the
    bottom panel.
    * Added: Possibility to choose font file in the options dialog.
    * Added: Player name is now customizable in the new game dialog.
    * Removed: Keyboard shortcuts F8 and F9 for debug fax and debug patients.
    * Change: Don't require debug mode to be able to dump the gamelog.
    * Change: The shortcut for dumping strings is now Ctrl+T instead of
    Ctrl+Shift+D.
    * Change: Restructured options window to make it more consistent, less
    clutter-y and smaller. 
    * Change: It is now possible to concentrate research on operating theatre
      diseases and redistribution of research is automatically done when
      a category has been completely researched.
    * Change: Add disease name to patients' treatment history when they are 
      diagnosed.
    * Change: Buttons on the bottom panel for fullscreen windows are now
      toggle buttons.
    * Change: Reordered entries of graphs menu to correspond with order in
      bottom panel.
    * Fix: Colour selection algorithm for freetype fonts resulted in
    unreadable text on faxes for some languages.
    * Fix: When an unanswered fax became meaningless (e.g. if you built the 
      required room), it was only removed if its message button was visible
      at the bottom panel (not if it was queued because of 5 buttons being
      there already).
    * Fix: Update the drug casebook if the last room of one kind explodes.
    * Fix: The directory browser was not always shown if the chosen Theme
    Hospital install directory was illegal.
    * Fix: Settings changed in the game will be saved immediately so that
    they persist to the next session regardless of how the game is shut down.
    * Fix: The bottom panel is no longer always on top, making fullscreen
      dialogs truly fullscreen on 640x480.
    * Fix: Don't play any announcements if there is no receptionist to do it.
    * Fix: The adviser would not idle again if a new message arrived as he
    was idling from a previous message.
    * Fix: While a player viewed the confirm dialog to delete a room he/she
    could continue to edit the room and complete it again resulting in an
      inconsistent game state.

    --- Graphics ---
    * Added: The graph dialog now actually displays graphs and statistics
    information.
    * Added: It is now possible to choose among three colour scales for
    warmth level. Look in the top menu for this choice.
    * Added: Print some info in the command prompt when the user wants to
    take a screenshot, so he can see if and why it failed.
    * Added: Screenshot functionality for OpenGL version.
    * Change: Screenshots get saved to a dedicated screenshot folder now, 
      which can be changed in the config.
    * Fix: Loading a game on startup where a fullscreen window was open would
      open with the font messed up.
    * Fix: Taking a screenshot (Ctrl+S) is now possible under windows without
      fiddling in a lua file.

    --- Translations ---
    * Added: The beginning of Brazilian Portuguese and Hungarian.
    * Change: The "utf8" prefix has been obsolete for some time and has been
      removed from all language files.

    --- When using Demo files ---
    * Fix: The game would crash if the player tried to open the staff
    management dialog by clicking on a staff portrait in the staff dialog.
