corsix-th (0.30-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (LP: #1284855)
    --- Gameplay ---
    * Change: You can now build more than one desk in the ward. More nurses
    means a slightly faster throughput.
    * Change: Patients would previously queue outside toilets even though
    there were free loos since it was dependent on number of people in the
    room. Now, as soon as a loo becomes free another patient enters the room
    to use it, even if there is a long queue for the sink). 
    If there is a queue for the sinks there is a chance the patient will
    leave without washing their hands - but will not be happy about doing
    this. 
    * Added: The ability to control alien behaviour - sitting, knocking
    doors, only to be available through emergency or arrive like all other
      patients.
    * Added: Winning fax opens automatically and pauses the game.
    * Added: Option to automatically accept wage increase requests when they
    "time out".
    * Added: A new option allows for your average build content for each type
    of room to be remembered, so will be added for each new room built later.
    * Fix: Doctors should get stuck less often, and handymen should not crash
    the game as frequently.
    * Fix: It was not possible to replace a surgeon when a patient was in the
    room.
    * Fix: Patients would sometimes get stuck inside a room when they should 
      have died.

    --- User Interface ---
    * Added: A new customization menu in the Options dialog. Most options
    from the configuration file are now available for change in-game.
    * Added: A new directory menu in the Options dialog.
    * Added: The game does now check for a more recent version of itself when
      launching.
    * Added: A helpful message when the player puts more Researchers in the
      research department than there are desks.
    * Added: The game now does a small integrity check on the Theme Hospital
      files to make sure that the most common corruptions are not present.
    * Added: Confirm dialog to the quit/exit button on the main menu.
    * Fix: The tooltip for the tutorial button was incorrect since the dialog
      has been visually changed.
    * Fix: The announcer has had a few corrections made to his manuscripts.
      He is very happy about this!
    * Removed: The settings menu is no longer available from within the game.

    --- Hotkeys ---
    Some hotkeys have been changed and/or added:
    * Alt + A = Toggle Announcements
    * Alt + M = Toggle Music
    * Alt + S = Toggle Sound Effects
    * Shift and + to zoom in five steps and Shift and - to zoom out five
    steps at a time.

    --- Campaign levels ---
    * Fix: An error in level 8 made it possible to win without meeting the
      reputation criterion.

    --- Custom levels ---
    * Change: For random emergencies each illness now has its own average
    number of patients to spawn. Previously they were all the same.
    * Fix: Researching improvements was not really possible on some custom
    levels, i.e. if the map creator had made it so there were no machines at
    the start.

    --- Demo files ---
    * Fix: When winning the demo level CorsixTH looked for another level to
    load, showing the wrong fax options and eventually crashing.

    --- Languages ---
    * Added: Korean language.
    * Fix: It was not possible to dump strings for a language with unicode 
      characters in the name.

    --- Compiling ---
    * Fix: You could not compile the game with WITH_AUDIO=0 if SDL_mixer was
      not present at all.
    * Fix: WITH_AUDIO=OFF is now illegal in combination with WITH_MOVIES=ON.

corsix-th (0.21-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    This is mainly a bugfix release, but a few minor features are still also
    introduced, see the changelog below. 

    --- Gameplay ---
    * Fix: Staff would sometimes not go for a break.
    * Fix: A few crashes related to Handymen.
    * Fix: An error could occur if a fax message was removed just as it was
    animating into view.
    * Fix: Patients could sometimes be told to go home multiple times,
      resulting in a crash.
    * Fix: If a queueing patient was heading for a drinks machine just as the
    player moved that machine the game would crash.

    --- User Interface ---
    * Added: Scrolling momentum when using the middle button.
    * Added: There is now a clock in the right corner of the menu bar that
      shows the real world time. It can be toggled between AM/PM and 24h
      in the configuration file.

    --- Hotkeys ---
    * Added: Hotkeys for the Jukebox (J), Save game menu (Shift + S),
      Load game menu (Shift + L), to restart the level (Shift + R) and
      finally
      quit the current game and take you back to the opening screen (Shift +
      Q). 
    * Change: Restart is now Shift + F10 instead of only F10.
    * Change: Toggle adviser is now Shift + A instead of only A.
    * Change: Key combinations will only trigger if that exact combination
      is pressed. E.g. Ctrl + R will not trigger R too.
    * Change: Alt + F4 is now the hotkey to quit CorsixTH. 
    * Fix: Added a configuration option to have the possibility to use Shift
    + C
      as hotkey to open the Drug casebook instead of C. This is to workaround
      a bug that when you press on the volume down key on your keyboard
      the Drug casebook would open. 

    --- Map Editor ---
    * Added: Undo/Redo functionality.
    * Added: Street lamps and the dead looking tree.

    For a complete list, visit the issue tracker: 
    http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th/issues/list

    --- Gameplay ---
    * Added: Radiators and other "edge tile" objects now occupy just one edge
    of the tile, inline with the original game. As a result one tile
    corridors can now be heated properly. An addition is that you can place
    many such objects on a single tile as long as they face different
    directions.
    * Added: Possibility to play movies in-game. At the moment the intro
    movie, advancement between levels and the win/lose movies has been added.
    * Added: The atom analyzer can now be built in the research department if
    it is available on the map.
    * Added: User actions are no longer allowed by default (for new games)
    when the game is paused. When trying this it might seem like it doesn't
    work correctly, but we try to mimic the original as much as possible.
    This for example means that a staff member being placed as you pause
    will disappear from the cursor. We might change this behaviour in the
    future though.
    * Added: Some background sounds, coughs, phones ringing etc. 
    * Change: Placing a member of staff inside a room that is already
    occupied will now replace that person.
    * Fix: Earthquakes could be four times as severe as intended. Still todo:
      A tremor before a coming big earthquake.
    * Fix: Crashes in certain situations involving receptionists and
    reception desks.
    * Fix: Patients being handled at a reception desk even if no receptionist
      is present.
    * Fix: Allow patients to be sent to the research room only if the
    corresponding room is not yet researched (so not if it is researched but
    not built).
    * Fix: Don't cancel a place staff action just because the player happens
    to click on a door.
    * Fix: The VIP would try to sit down if there was a queue for the
    reception desk. The VIP will no longer ever try to sit down, and he will
    have priority in the queue anyway.
    * Fix: If a member of staff was done resting at the same time as he/she
    was also finished using the pool table or the video game another object
    in the room could get reserved indefinitely.

    --- User Interface ---
    * Added: You can now see in the bank statement which drug company a
    certain drug was bought from. It has no effect on gameplay though.
    * Added: The adviser now tells you why the research screen can't be
    opened before you have built a research department.
    * Added: The Town Map functionality has been extended inline with Theme
      Hospital. For example, if you right-click somewhere in your hospital
      the view will be moved there.
    * Added: Available options on open faxes now gets updated if for example
    a room explodes or the player builds a research department.
    * Added: Keyboard shortcuts F1 - F9 for the fullscreen windows. They are
    NOT the same as in original TH but instead correspond to the order on the
    bottom panel.
    * Added: Possibility to choose font file in the options dialog.
    * Added: Player name is now customizable in the new game dialog.
    * Removed: Keyboard shortcuts F8 and F9 for debug fax and debug patients.
    * Change: Don't require debug mode to be able to dump the gamelog.
    * Change: The shortcut for dumping strings is now Ctrl+T instead of
    Ctrl+Shift+D.
    * Change: Restructured options window to make it more consistent, less
    clutter-y and smaller. 
    * Change: It is now possible to concentrate research on operating theatre
      diseases and redistribution of research is automatically done when
      a category has been completely researched.
    * Change: Add disease name to patients' treatment history when they are 
      diagnosed.
    * Change: Buttons on the bottom panel for fullscreen windows are now
      toggle buttons.
    * Change: Reordered entries of graphs menu to correspond with order in
      bottom panel.
    * Fix: Colour selection algorithm for freetype fonts resulted in
    unreadable text on faxes for some languages.
    * Fix: When an unanswered fax became meaningless (e.g. if you built the 
      required room), it was only removed if its message button was visible
      at the bottom panel (not if it was queued because of 5 buttons being
      there already).
    * Fix: Update the drug casebook if the last room of one kind explodes.
    * Fix: The directory browser was not always shown if the chosen Theme
    Hospital install directory was illegal.
    * Fix: Settings changed in the game will be saved immediately so that
    they persist to the next session regardless of how the game is shut down.
    * Fix: The bottom panel is no longer always on top, making fullscreen
      dialogs truly fullscreen on 640x480.
    * Fix: Don't play any announcements if there is no receptionist to do it.
    * Fix: The adviser would not idle again if a new message arrived as he
    was idling from a previous message.
    * Fix: While a player viewed the confirm dialog to delete a room he/she
    could continue to edit the room and complete it again resulting in an
      inconsistent game state.

    --- Graphics ---
    * Added: The graph dialog now actually displays graphs and statistics
    information.
    * Added: It is now possible to choose among three colour scales for
    warmth level. Look in the top menu for this choice.
    * Added: Print some info in the command prompt when the user wants to
    take a screenshot, so he can see if and why it failed.
    * Added: Screenshot functionality for OpenGL version.
    * Change: Screenshots get saved to a dedicated screenshot folder now, 
      which can be changed in the config.
    * Fix: Loading a game on startup where a fullscreen window was open would
      open with the font messed up.
    * Fix: Taking a screenshot (Ctrl+S) is now possible under windows without
      fiddling in a lua file.

    --- Translations ---
    * Added: The beginning of Brazilian Portuguese and Hungarian.
    * Change: The "utf8" prefix has been obsolete for some time and has been
      removed from all language files.

    --- When using Demo files ---
    * Fix: The game would crash if the player tried to open the staff
    management dialog by clicking on a staff portrait in the staff dialog.
