Description: Urban Terror client binary
 This package contains the client binary for UrbanTerror.

 Urban Terror could best be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; it is
 realism based to a certain extent (environments/weapons/player models), but
 also goes by the motto "fun over realism" (fast gameplay and lots of action).
 This combination of reality and action results in a very unique, enjoyable and
 addictive game.
