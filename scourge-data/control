Description: Cross platform, open source rogue-like game (data files)
 S.C.O.U.R.G.E. is a cross platform, open source rogue-like
 game in the fine tradition of NetHack and Moria It sports
 a graphical front-end, similar to glHack or the Falcon's
 eye.The design of the 3D UI is an attempt at the best of
 both worlds from old to new: It lets you rotate the view,
 zoom in/out, view special effects, etc with the feeling of
 the old-school isometric games like Exult or Woodward.
 .
 This package contains the data files.
