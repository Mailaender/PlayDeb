Description: Bishoujo-style visual novel
 Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the
 fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children,
 located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal
 boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down
 when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a
 new school after a long hospitalization.
 Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find
 friendsâ€”and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right.
 There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main
 female characters, each path following the storyline
 pertaining to that character.
