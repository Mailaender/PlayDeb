    Alterations

    This is the development version of Secret of Ultimate Legendary
    Fantasy: Unleashed, complete with source code. I hereby grant all
    users permission to modify this game and to distribute derivative
    works, provided that the following conditions are met:

    1. The title screen (WSPLASH), main menu (WMAIN), and "Be Nice" window
       (WMONEY) must remain intact and unchanged.

    2. The disclaimer and distribution text above must be included and
       abided by.

    3. This manual must be included.

    4. The high standard of quality must be maintained. Official-ish
       releases should be voted on by members of the Official-ish forum,
       and the virtue system should be expanded. It must always change
       for the better.

    5. The NICEWARE system must remain working and enforced - no "work
       arounds" may be made. In order to access all character classes,
       the player must type "I SWEAR I DID SOMETHING NICE" one time per
       session.
