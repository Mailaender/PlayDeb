New command:
- demoavi <demo name>
New variables:
- cl_demoavi_fps <value>
- cl_demoavi_sccissor "1|0"


Command - demoavi <demo name>
----------------------
Will play a demo, and automaticly export the img files into your screenshots/AVI directory in your basewsw folder. 
If, while playing a demo, demoavi command is used with no <demo name> provided, it will toggle screenshot exporting state.


Cvar - cl_demoavi_fps <value>
-------------------------
This variable will set how fast imgs will be written to your hard drive. 
We recommend keeping this lower than 30, for the sake of not having 700megs-10 minute video files. If you set this to 25, your video file will have 25 fps as well.


Cvar - cl_demoavi_scissor "1|0"
----------------------------
Quote from the config guide:
  
  "cg_viewSize "40-100"
describes how big you want the actual view of the game to be (has nothing to do with fov)
if you set this to 40, 40% of your screen will be used to draw the game, the rest will be
filled with some background texture (remember the old doom games?) "

When you set "cl_demoavi_scissor 0" this value will be ignored, and will export an img of the intire screen
(when you have set cg_viewsize, it'll also export the borders).
when you set "cl_demoavi_scissor 1" the cg_viewsize value will be used, and the exported imgs will be smaller than your screensize.
We recommend keeping this to 0 & also having "cg_viewsize 100"


Tips:

- r_screenshot_jpeg "1|0"
--------------------------
1: Screenshots will be written as JPEG's
0: Screenshots will be written as tga's 


- r_screenshot_jpeg_quality "85"
---------------------------------
It defines the quality of the JPG img's.
