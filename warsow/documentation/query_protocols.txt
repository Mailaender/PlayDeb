:: :: Query protocols for Warsow 0.3

:: General

These protocols are either very similar to protocols used by various Quake
games, or even exactly the same. Masterservers are not specific for Warsow,
they run on dpmaster software and also support other games.

In this document C styled string definitions are used, they are displayed
inside double quotes ("). When a text inside lesser than and greater than signs
is used inside this kind of string, it means custom content that will be
specified later.

All queries are done by sending UDP packet to the server or masterserver.
These packets are marked to be connectionless (not part of in-game
communication) packets by first four bytes of the message. These bytes are to
have all bits sets. So these 4 byte header should be "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF". All
response packet are also UDP packets with the same header.

:: Master server

Masters servers keep list of public Warsow servers. You can fetch this list by
using following messages.

Requesting:
"getservers Warsow 9 <flags>"

Here Warsow is the name of the application and 9 is the protocol number.
The protocol number of Warsow is likely to increase in next major release.

Allowed flags are "full" and "empty". These control whether to include servers
that are full or empty. So sending a message without any flags returns neither
full or empty servers.

Response:
"getserversResponse\\<list of servers>\\EOT\0\0\0"

The actual list of server is made of IPv4 addresses. For each server there is 4
bytes for the actual IP address and 2 bytes for the port number. These bytes
are big endian oriented.

:: Info (short)

This is a short string with the most interesting information about the game
server.

Requesting:
"info 9 <flags>"

9 is the protocol number.
The protocol number of Warsow is likely to increase in next major release.

Allowed flags are "full" and "empty". These control whether the server should
respond if it is full or empty. Sending a message without any flags means that
the server will only reply if it has players, but is not full.

Reply:
"info\n<list of key-value pairs>\\EOT"

Here the list of key-value pairs is in following format:
"\\key1\\value1\\key2\\value2"
...and so on.

List of keys and values sent by Warsow version 0.4:

n       hostname
m       map name

b       "%2i", number of bots in game
ig      instagib enabled: 0 or 1
mm      whether server can be used as matchmaking server

If b, p or be value is missing, the value is quaranteed to be 0.
In the future new key value pairs maybe be added.

:: Info (long)

This is longer string that has all the information the server is giving out
about it's status.

Requesting:
"getinfo <string>"

If string is specified it will be echoed by server in it's response.

Reply:
"infoResponse\n<status string>\n<player list>\\challenge\\<string>"

String is the parameter given to the getinfo request.

Status string is list of key-value pairs in the follow format:
"\\key1\\value1\\key2\\value2"
...and so on.

Both keys and values have maximum length of 64 characters.
