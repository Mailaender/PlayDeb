m_filter:
	"m_filter" set to "2" now activates mouse extrapolation filter, which calculates a weighted
         average over the last few mouse deltas to predict the next cursor position. This makes the
         game appear more responsive to strong mouse movement (e.g. 180° flick rails), especially at
         low framerates.

m_filterStrength:
	A new cvar "m_filterStrength" now controls the strength of the inter- and extrapolation
        filters set by m_filter = "1" or "2" respectively. The default being "1" results in the old
        smoothing behavior of m_filter = "1". Higher values with m_filter "1" make the mouse "lag
        behind", much like in first-person role-playing games. If m_filter is set to "2",
        responsiveness will appear to increase with m_filterStrength, but at some point (anything >
        "1.0") imo, the screen will appear shaky due to overly optimistic predictions and
        subsequent corrections. The perfect balance between crispness and shakyness depends on the
        framerate and mouserate. In general, extrapolation is most useful at low framerates where
        there's a noticeable delay between mouse movement and screen update otherwise.
