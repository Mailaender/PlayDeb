Recopilation of commands:

"demoPause" pauses the demo. It's not a democam command, but very useful
            for editing (on/off accepted since 0.3).

"timescale" scales time up or down. smaller than 1.0 is slow motion, bigger
            fast motion. It's not a democam command, but very useful for editing.

"demoEditMode" enable/disables editing mode. It accepts "on" and "off" for
               binding too (bind <key> demoEditMode on).

"demoFreeFly" : in edit mode freefly along the map to position cameras. This command
                also accepts "on"/"off". If none is added, acts as toggle. When off
                it's preview mode.

"addcam <type name>" : adds a cam at current position in current time.
        types:
        "FirstPerson"
        "ThirdPerson"
        "Positional"
        "Path_linear"
        "Path_spline"
        "orbital"


"editcam <command>" : edits the current cam
       editcam  commands:
       type <type name>
       track <entity number> ( 0 for no track )
       fov <value> ( only for not player view cams )
       timeOffset <milliseconds> ( move camera in time by + or - milliseconds )
       origin ( changes cam to current origin )
       angles ( changes cam to current angles )
       pitch <value> ( assigns pitch angle to current cam )
       yaw <value> ( assigns yaw angle to current cam )
       roll <value> ( assigns roll angle to current cam )

"deletecam" : deletes the current cam in playback (current as in the info printed in screen)
"clearcams" : deletes every cam in memory.
"saverecam <optional name>" : saves the .cam script file with the changes. If no name
                              is provided the demo name is used (it must have the demo
                              name to be played).
"importcams <filename>" : imports a .cam file. File path is relative to the demos directory.
                          The cameras imported are merged with the previously existing, if any.
                          Use at your own risk.

//########### Camera types #######################

"FirstPerson" : While in this camera, the demo will show the player first person view
"ThirdPerson" : While in this camera, the demo will show the player third person view
"Positional"  : Static camera which doesn't move. It can be set to track an entity so it's
                view can auto-aim it. It can make use of custom fov values. Positional cams
                must also be used to finish path_linear cam trajectories. 
"Path_linear" : This camera will move from it's position to the next camera position.
                The next camera can be another path_linear camera or a positional camera.
                Path linear camera movement involves origin, viewangles and fov. All them
                will be "moved" to from it, to the next camera ones.
                Path_linear cameras can also track entities.
                Remember: A path_linear cam array must be finished in a positional cam.
"Path_spline" : Works the same as path_linear, but produces smooth curve paths.
"Orbital"     : A orbital camera will orbit around it's track entity, and will always look
                to it's track entity. This camera requires having a track entity assigned,
                and won't work without it.
                The radius of the rotation will be defined by the distance from the original
                camera placement to the track entity the first time the camera is activated.
                The rotation speed will be defined by the pitch, yaw and roll values of the
                camera. They will be set to 0, 96, 0 (horizontal rotation) at adding the camera
                and can be modified by editing the camera with editcam.
