Fix: Converting/removing illegal chars in a nick. Used for autoaction file-creation.

Fix: Grenades now bounce down slopes.

Fix: "weapnext" and "weapprev" now work correctly (handled client-side so there's no more annoyng no ammo messages,
     and not going in the wrong direction any more).

Fix: Hud rescaling to 800x600 virtual screen & HUD numbers proportional in virtual screen.
     And a brand new HUD system, rewritten from scratch : ).
     Teams score support in hud for team gametypes  (STAT_TEAM_(RED|BLUE|GREEN|YELLOW)_SCORE)
     SetFont to set any font you want in your HUD.

Add: new midair map (wmid3, hexagons made by blemish)
)
Add: Implement BattlEye anti-cheat system (go to http://www.battleye.com for more information)
     Serverside: sv_battleye cvar (0 = disabled, 1 = optional, 2 = required)
     Clientside: cl_battleye cvar (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled), BattlEye.dll (anti-cheat client)

Add: Challenger's queue for all gametypes

Add: Localtime to console.

Add: Stats command (/stats). This will list all of the weapons and your respective accuracies with them.
		 When speccing it display the stats of the chased player.
		 
Add: Support for downloading files (maps) from the server using a web server. 
     Fail when the asked file does not exist on the web server
     Support for resuming downloads

Add: Announcer, vsays, and chat tokens (macros) lists in /docs

Add: "demopause" function

Add: Shortcut "flag" to command "drop"

Add: Bots now have better AI and aim. Hf & gl with'm :)

Add: Missing walljump sounds.

Add: vsay and vsay_team commands. Works ET-like. It plays a sound (a voice chat) and shows an icon on player's head. The netcode has been
     adjusted so that players who aren't in thesame team won't hear nor see the chattokens. vsay headicons to team layouts besides each
     player name and location, so it's easy to know where the requesting player is.
     Currently accepted tokens are:
	needhealth
	needweapon
	needarmor
	affirmative
	negative
	yes
	no
	ondefense
	onoffense
	oops
	sorry
	thanks
	noproblem
	yeehaa
	goodgame
	defend
	attack
	needbackup

Add: Flood protection check to vsays, you won't be able to spam YEEHAW anymore : p

Add: Bots use vsay. Pretty much randomly, but it adds nice ambient to the match.

Add: Enable Team Tabs (locations) on CTF too (small team overlay)

Add: Pings are displayed in color now
     (green is 0<=ping<50, yellow 50<=ping<90, orange 90<=ping<120, red : ping >= 120)

Add: Spawn selection code for CTF (rule is randomly choose a spawn point from all matching your team color)

Add: Tweak bots for better ctf playing.

Add: in_minmsecs cvar. Increasing it, relaxes input update ratio.

Add: cg_enemyModel, cg_enemySkin, cg_teamModel and cg_teamSkin to force a warsow skin to a team.

Add: Self shadow on models.

Add: Captures in jpg when r_screenshotJPG is enabled.

Add: More splash radius to Gunblade.

Add: Generic weapon model for missing weapon models.shader

Add: cg_damage_kick, cg_damage_blend and cg_pickup_flash cvars.

Add: Prestep for all projectiles. Prestep is something to compensate network delay. 
     When you would fire a rocket in the previous version of war§ow
     the rocket would be drawn immediatly after you clicked. 
		 Now it's being spawned and instantly travel some msec ahead using its own speed, 
		 thus feeling as if that projectile was fired a bit earlier in the past and 
		 so compensating some lags. This make the game feel more responsive.  

Add: A pair of missing ammo box shaders (riotgun and spawngun ammos)

Add: The outline effect to armors items.

Add: Each time the client returns to the ui from demos, videos, everything is a disconnect.

Add: Shortcut "weapon" to command "drop" will drop current weapon. 

Add: automatic sorting of demos and screenshot in autoaction (autorecord/gametype/foo.bar)

Add: Distance fade effect to player names, with new cvars: 
	cg_showPlayerNames:         toggles player names
	cg_showPlayerNames_alpha:   transpacency of names, for 0 to 1, 1 being opaque
	cg_showPlayerNames_zfar:    distance from where the names are printed or not
	cg_showPlayerNames_xoffset: 2d horizontal offset of the name from the player
	cg_showPlayerNames_yoffset: 2d vertical offset of the name from the player

Add: Teleporting effect on both side of the tele.

Add: cvar: cl_compresspackets (default 0, options: 0-1). Allows the client to decide if he wants the client to compress
     the ucmds he's sending to the server. Ucmd packets are generated very fast, while they are of a very
     small size. It's not really worth compressing them, but cpus don't really have any problem
     with doing it. The choice is yours.

Add: (cheat, meaning: use devmap to use it, or cheats enabled, or race) cg_showPlayerTrails (value is time, in ms)

Add: Reward messages for midair

Add: cg_playerTrailsColor cvar to change the color of the player trails (for demos and race mode) 
     default is: "0.0 1.0 0.0"
     format is "r g b" with r,g,b [0.0 .. 1.0]

Add: cvar: g_challengers_queue and callvote challengers_gueue.
     In team gametypes, the half of the players with the lower scores will be put as spectators if we enable the challengers
     queue (and of course, the players inside the challengers queue will be put inside the teams at the start of the warmup).
     I don't know if it's desirable to enable it or not, but the code should be already working.

Add: Command line option -hwtimer to use high resolution performance counter if available (win32 only).
     Enabling this on the command line (shortcut) will result in a better timer system for war§ow. Notes:
     This won't always work, some computers don't like this and there is no linux support yet, so the linux servers can't enable this.
     People who do have no trouble with this should enable it, even when playing on linux servers.

Add: mouse wheel support for scrolling in ui (server, demos, binds ...)

Add: cvars: con_fontSystemSmall and con_fontSystemMedium to allow to use user custom fonts.

Add: ctf bonus for extending flag reset countdown. Fix double flags and no-flag captures (hopefully)

Add: 2 new target entities to help mapping for our ctf:
     "target_reset_flag_countdown" // can't be triggered by flag carriers.
     "target_freeze_flag_countdown" // can only be triggered by flag carriers.

Add: New fonts system that allows you to create and a use your own fonts for console, ui and scoreboards.
     Also able to set a different font for each print in the HUD scripts.

Add: Pings in servers browser.

Add: Health/armor bars on teammates.

Add: Simple projected shadows on models. And the most important, a smoother overall feeling.

Del: cvars cg_crosshairX, cg_crosshairY, cg_crosshairSize.

Del: Shockwave and lasergun wrong weapon models.

Chg: Scalable scoreboard.

Chg: In-game menu has been updated.

Chg: cg_grenadeTrail, cg_rocketTrail: Now mean density of the trail in smoke puffs per second.
     New cvars: cg_grenadeTrailAlpha, cg_rocketTrailAlpha

Chg: Winners stay inside the team at match end.

Chg: make vid_restart restart the sound engine as it also reinit all dlls.

Chg: Fire up BE when getting the BE bit from server.

Chg: Reject clients with BE disabled if we are a BE enabled server

Chg: make midair mod 1v1

Chg: Put back magenta color in ^6, move orange to ^8 and add grey at ^9.

Chg: Midair rules: the knockback was scaled differently + scoresystem is +1 to +5 depending on the distance of the fragged person

Chg: Make say_team prints in yellow tint, cause was quite hard to follow a say_team talk in the console.

Chg: Player hitboxes have thesame height as the model when standing, and are about half that length when ducked.

Chg: Riotgun now has a circular spread, the bullets in the circle are randomized.

Chg: Allow cg_predictLaserBeam values between 0 and 1
     This var shows the laserbeam as the server sees it. So if you set this to 0, you would have a true-laser for the server.
     Setting this to one would mean that the laserbeam is drawn as if it were on ping 0.

Chg: Switch LaserGun and ElectroBolt in weapon list

Chg: midair give quad if health >= 200

Chg: allow player to crouch while in air

Chg: Put spawnpoints on floor at load time unless they have the no drop spawnflag.

Chg: Allow server names up to 32 chars for the info msg

Chg: Set thirdperson at updating player POV

Chg: Use "andromeda" skins by Hubikc for silverclaw model. 
     Delete some never used models. 
     Update player models animation.cfg to use the rootanim command instead of bonekeys.

Chg: Skeletal pmodels now define their animations using rootanim command in their configs.

Chg: weapondefs to reflect splash damage changes. RL and PG now have same knockback as damage. GL now has
     same knockback and damage values as RL.

Chg: Splash damage and knockback changes: Calculates the distance of splash damage better. Uses different knockback
     direction for splash damage when hitting players. Takes mindamage into account when calculating knockback. Removes
     rocket jump and plasma climb hacks as they are no more needed.

Chg: Lasergun is able to use it's model projection source now.

Chg: Make bots adjust their skill to sv_skilllevel cvar

Chg: Add instant-hit weapons range to weapondefs. Create Lasergun weapondef files.

Chg: Add the outline effect to ammo pack and add the outline effect to the hud armor model.

Chg: Proper player model centering at ui_playerconfig

Chg: When callvoting gametype, don't change map, but go through scoreboards before switching. 
     Being so instant is confusing, and people likes to know how they were doing before the switch.

Chg: Improve team tabs so it sends smaller updates at a faster update ratio.

Chg: Faster respawning. Cvars g_respawn_delay_min and g_respawn_delay_max control it (in milliseconds).

Chg: Replace Huffman compression by ZLIB for the netcode. 

Chg: Switch BLUE-GREEN teams again, so BLUE is the 2nd team.

Chg: Use Q3A version of LoadTGA, so some textures from custom maps don't crash Warsow. 
     WARNING: This means LRE-compressed tgas aren't supported anymore.

Chg: Stop sending playerskins as ConfigString, index the player models from the server as any other model. 
     Same for skin files (added new trap_SkinIndex for them). Skins bug should be gone by now.

Chg: Register sexed sounds in player-model basis (same for weapon models sets).

Chg: New Armor protection rules. Those changes were made in an attemp to stop armor-runs and increase the amount of fights in a 1v1.
      GA: 25, 75; YA: 50, 100; RA 100, 200 - armor decay (to 150). All protection is 75, no matter the color. All degradation is 0.66.

Chg: More unified knockback for everything (still work to be done in physic_toss and bounce). 
     Adjust weapondefs; since there is an offset by the radius of the AAbox we are expanding 
     the radius of the explosion, so, for having the same radius as before, we have to reduce 
     the splash damages by the radius of AAbox.

Chg: Updated demos player (set read only on config.cfg in place of qfconfig.cfg)

Chg: Make projectiles use corpses solids. Should prevent projectiles stopping player movement and some rocket impact bugs

Chg: When in freefloat in teambased game make red team use teammodels and other teams use enemymodels

Med: New menu.

Med: Several new sfx, adjust volume and frequency.

Med: Added a mapshot for maps that don't have a mapshot included in their pk3 (unknownmap.jpg)

build v0.07. Revision xxx
Changes from version 0.06

add: added wtest4 for tdm/2v2

add: added wtest3 for duels

add: added wmid1 & wmid2 for midair

add: Add point and pickup tokens. Remove sight token. Add short names and colors for items
     Changed say_team tokens (now: health, armor, weapon, best weapons, location, point, point_location,
     last pickup, last pickup location, last drop, last drop location)
         %l=location
         %a=armor
         %h=health
         %b=best weapons
         %w=current weapon
         %x=point
         %y=point location
         %X=pickup
         %Y=pickup location
         %d=drop
         %D=drop location

add: The new netcode:
     Using packet fragmentation to remove every SZ_Getspace overflood crashes.
     Added a sv_pps cvar so server admin has the capability to set up his own server bandwitch use.
     Everything should work smoothly now. We haven't had a single crash since we released the new netcode ;-)
     In case you do get a server crash: feel free to contact us.

add: cg_simpleitemsSize cvar so set simple items icons size (default is 12)

add: demoavi <demo name>
     Will play a demo, and automaticly export the img files into your screenshots/AVI directory in your basewsw folder.

add: cl_demoavi "1|0"
     When you don't want to have the img files from the beginning of the demo, you can always use this variable,
     and toggle it whenever you have your right part in the demo.

add: cl_demoavi_fps <value>
     This variable will set how fast imgs will be written to your hard drive. We recommend keeping this lower than 30,
     for the sake of not having 700megs-10 minute video files. If you set this to 25, your video file will have 25 fps as well.

add: cl_demoavi_scissor "1|0"
     Quote from the config guide:
  
     "cg_viewSize "40-100"
     describes how big you want the actual view of the game to be (has nothing to do with fov)
     if you set this to 40, 40% of your screen will be used to draw the game, the rest will be
     filled with some background texture (remember the old doom games?) "

     When you set "cl_demoavi_scissor 0" this value will be ignored, and will export an img of the intire screen
     (when you have set cg_viewsize, it'll also export the borders).
     when you set "cl_demoavi_scissor 1" the cg_viewsize value will be used, and the exported imgs will be smaller than your screensize.
     We recommend keeping this to 0 & also having "cg_viewsize 100"

add: demoavi.txt (doc on the demoavi commands)

add: simple icons and shader for backpack

add: display a little box around selected weapon in weaponlist (cg_showWeaponSelect)
     1 means that it will draw the box around the selected weapon
     0 means that it won't draw the box around the selected weapon

add: unready command

add: a cvar to filter where obituaries message shall be printed (cg_showObituaries)
     0 : off
     1 : console
     2 : center
     3 : console and center

add: shaderlist.txt for easier mapping

add: Silverclaw player model

add: Monada player model + moinesse.shader (first compile)

add: cg_ShowPointedPlayer
     1 means that when your mouse moves over an enemy or teammate it will draw his name on the screen,
       below your mouse (defaults to this value)
     0 means it won't

fix: Make delete key work properly in console

fix: the console only displays one texture in the console, not two

fix: /kill command was missing a calls to Killed function

fix: we are now using a q3 like keyboard management (config and bind are done in qwerty,
