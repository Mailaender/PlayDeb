 -- Bastian Venthur <venthur@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Feb 2010 16:40:20 +0100

flightgear (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #510387.

    This includes depending on plib 1.8.5. Closes: #528635.

flightgear (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the pkg-fgfs-crew mailing list the official maintainer of the
    FlightGear package, and myself a mere uploader.
  * Updated libglut3-dev build-dependency to freeglut3-dev. Closes:
    #394491.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 21 Jun 2008 14:10:28 +0200

flightgear (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Homepage field.
  * Added flightgear.desktop file by Lukas Fittl. Closes: #409683.
  * Build-Depend on simgear-dev 1.0.0-3 or later.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu, 10 Apr 2008 10:13:54 +0200

flightgear (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

flightgear (0.9.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the build dependencies for xorg 7.0. Apparently the
    amd64 autobuilder doesn't use Provides.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 17 May 2006 17:12:09 -0400

flightgear (0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri,  5 May 2006 20:02:30 -0400

flightgear (0.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Martin Michlmayr and upstream CVS for
    g++ 4.1 build failure. Closes: #356598.
    (Martin also reported a link failure, but I see no reason
    that should happen in a clean build, and upstream doesn't
    seem to have had that kind of issue either, so he probably
    just got a misbuild from his experimentations.)
  * Build-Depend on libalut-dev, and simgear 0.3.9-3.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 19 Mar 2006 06:47:39 -0500

flightgear (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #341727.
    Includes completely rewritten 3D clouds. Closes: #330861.
    (Other stuff: a working aircraft carrier, new aircraft,
    high-G blackouts, better weather, improved multiplayer,
    and much more.)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  2 Jan 2006 15:49:28 -0500

flightgear (0.9.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with gcc-4.0-compiled simgear.

flightgear (0.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #264625.
  * Upstream seem to have switched to OpenAL.
    Added build-dependency on libopenal-dev.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 16 Aug 2004 19:57:03 +0200

flightgear (0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Should (hopefully) fix current GCC issues.
    Closes: #243226.
  * Changed Build-Depends for new xlibs package layout.
  * Changed Build-Depends to depend on plib1.8.3-dev.
    Closes: #242336.
  * Removed MetaKit build-dependency, flightgear apparently
    stopped using it in 0.9.3.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed,  7 Apr 2004 10:48:30 +0200

flightgear (0.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Yay, helicopters!
  * Install TerraSync README file into /usr/share/doc/flightgear.
    Closes: #201256.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun,  9 Nov 2003 23:07:41 +0100

flightgear (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release compiles against plib 1.6.0. Closes: #160191.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  9 Sep 2002 19:47:56 +0200

flightgear (0.7.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forgot to update the version of that simgear build-dep
    again, needs 0.0.18. Closes: #146788.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 13 May 2002 05:32:34 +0200

flightgear (0.7.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 27 Apr 2002 19:45:50 +0200

flightgear (0.7.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with metakit 2.4.3.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 27 Mar 2002 21:50:15 +0100

flightgear (0.7.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made debian/rules try hard to get this compiled; if compiling
    with optimization fails, then it'll try again without.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu,  7 Mar 2002 13:46:58 +0100

flightgear (0.7.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Yes, I'm subscribed to flightgear-announce, so I knew about 0.7.9
    already, but packaging new releases of this stuff takes some time.
    Closes: #134302.
  * Playing the intro music doesn't seem to hang fgfs in this release,
    and it's no longer played by default anyway. Closes: #104168.
  * Man pages seem to be available now. Closes: #87556, #87557, #87560, #87561.
  * Some binaries without manpages are no longer installed.
    (This includes runfgfs.) Closes: #87558, #87559, #87562.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 12:35:41 +0100

flightgear (0.7.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-depend on plib >= 1.4.1.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 14 Jul 2001 21:55:05 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Grr... if the plib maintainer keeps insisting on keeping
    an "=" dependency on stable releases so I have to keep rebuilding
    this stuff all the time, I'll soon be in the mood to hijack plib.
    Well, this rebuild closes: #102769.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue,  3 Jul 2001 03:41:31 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I realized I ought to do a versioned simgear-dev build-dep a few
    hours after the last upload, but this stuff takes a while to
    rebuild and I thought the autobuilders might be able to get it
    right this one time anyway, but they don't, it seems, so I
    guess I have to. It build-depends on simgear-dev >= 0.0.15,
    and plib-dev >= 1.4.0 while I'm at it. Closes: #102364.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 26 Jun 2001 19:56:30 +0200

flightgear (0.7.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * This release has support for multithreaded tile loading.
    Since Debian can do multithreading, I added --with-threads
    to the configure command.
  * Build-depend on autotools-dev.
    Update config.guess and config.sub from it.
  * Build-depend on debhelper v3.
  * Standards-Version updated to 3.5.5.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri, 22 Jun 2001 17:27:20 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * I can't believe I put the wrong bug number in my previos
    changelog entry (I managed to try to close one of my
    already-closed bugs)... Oh well, for the "install binaries
    into /usr/games" change, I meant: Closes: #90569. So there!

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  2 Apr 2001 02:18:47 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install binaries into /usr/games. Closes: #87269.
  * Data directory moved from /usr/share/FlightGear to
    /usr/share/games/FlightGear.
    Depends on fgfs-base (>= 0.7.6-4) to do this move.
  * Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. Upgrade Standars-Version to 3.5.2.
    (it's a cleaner way to "build without -g on sparc" anyway)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu, 29 Mar 2001 21:26:36 +0200

flightgear (0.7.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build without -g, to work around a g++ bug on sparc.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 18 Mar 2001 17:12:08 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The plib maintainer keeps on making the lives of
    plib users miserable with his shlibs file. Despite being
    completely equivalent with the previous build, the new plib
    package still has incompatible shlibs, forcing me to recompile.
    Closes: #87269.
  * Added --with-network-olk (networking support) to configure options
    since I had to recompile anyway, so not completely for naught.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat,  3 Mar 2001 19:23:00 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * For some reason the plib maintainer use shlibs depending
    on the exact debian revision, so everything using plib has
    to be rebuilt whenever he uploads a bugfix or something.
  * Well, now built with debhelper v3, at least.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 21 Feb 2001 15:58:38 +0100

flightgear (0.7.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. Closes: #85060.
  * Patched for FHS conformance.
  * Added missing libs to a few link command lines.
