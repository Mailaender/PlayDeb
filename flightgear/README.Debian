Flight Gear for Debian
----------------------

Start Flight Gear with fgfs.

Additional scenery is available at http://www.flightgear.org/.
The tile files should be unpacked into /usr/share/games/FlightGear/Scenery.
The scenery files include a SharedModels.tgz, which may have extra/updated
models used in some scenery tiles. Unpack this into /usr/share/games/FlightGear.
