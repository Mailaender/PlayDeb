Description: Open-source game based on the "Sonic the Hedgehog" universe
 Open Sonic is a free open-source game based on the
 "Sonic the Hedgehog" universe. It introduces a different
 style of gameplay called cooperative play, in which it's
 possible to control 3 characters simultaneously. Unlike
 most similar games, Open Sonic provides a greater level
 of interaction between the player and the levels. It's
 more than just a jump'n'run; the user must come up with
 some strategy in order to get through the levels.
