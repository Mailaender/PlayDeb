Scorched3D on x86_64/amd64 (and maybe other 64 bit architectures)
=================================================================

When the game window is closed, the underlying process often crashes (segfaults) 
and as a result the user is asked if he/she wishes Scorch3D to reduce some game 
settings. Chose "No.", because having your settings changed usually won't help 
either.
