Reporting Scorched3D bugs:
-------------------------

Before you submit any bugreport, please read information from 
/usr/share/doc/scorched3d/README.Debian file.
It describes most common problems and their workarounds.

You can try to post a message on Scorched3D's forum
(http://scorched3d.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/).
That's what I usually do with the submitted bugreports.

If you still want to submit bugreport, please make sure that you have 
included information about your graphic card, especially chipset, model 
and amount of memory. Also please make sure you're using the most recent 
drivers for it.

If the game crashes and you are familiar with debbuging, please try 
to provide backtrace made with unstripped binary. 
The /usr/share/doc/scorched3d/README.Debian file also describes how to do it.
