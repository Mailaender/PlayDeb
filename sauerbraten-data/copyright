The Sauerbraten game is freeware, you may freely distribute the Sauerbraten archive/installer unmodified on any media. You may re-compress using different archival formats suitable for your OS (i.e. zip/tgz/rpm/deb/dmg), any changes beyond that require my explicit permission.

You may play Sauerbraten for any purpose as long as you don't blame me for any damages incurred.

If you want to produce new content with the sauerbraten engine, you have to be aware that the source code may be Open Source, but the game and the media it consist of have their individual licenses and copyrights. This means that you have roughly 3 options:

    * You may produce new content for the sauerbraten game, for example as a "custom map" (.ogz/.cfg/textures etc). Contributing to the original game is most welcome, and the most productive way of working with sauerbraten.
    * If you want to create your own gameplay beyond what you can do with a map, the best way to do this is as a "mod" (same as above, but with new executable that incorporates your gameplay), that requires an existing install of sauerbraten, and installs only the new files you created in parallel to the existing files.
    * If you insist on making a standalone game based on sauerbraten, do realize that only the sourcecode is yours to use freely (if you abide by the ZLIB license, see below), not the media. You CANNOT simply redistribute the entire sauerbraten package with your modified files, as the majority of game media is not yours to use freely (it is made by many authors with a variety of licences and copyright restrictions). Unless you have explicit permission from the authors, or the readme says explicitly "may be used for any purpose" or similar language, it will be illegal to include in your standalone game based on the sauerbraten engine (you may not assume that just because a file has no explicit license, that it is free of copyright). Therefore, if you wish to produce a standalone game, be prepared to make many of the maps, models, textures, sounds etc from scratch yourself.

In this sense sauerbraten is similar to games like Quake (its code is Open Source, but its media is not), it is a game that is meant to be added to, not copied and used as a template. Sauerbraten is not meant to be a quick game creation kit, it is a game.

                          ik2k_skylake.zip     (environment map)

Description             : 278 high-res, truecolor textures that can
                          be used in Q3A or any other game that uses
                          TGA or JPG. Broken up in different categories
                          based on material or theme.

                          Q3A shader files are provided with the
                          textures that require them. You will need
                          to change the texture path names to use
                          with your own levels though.

Installation            : You should unzip the texture files into
                          separate folders, and move individual
                          textures into your level's texture folder
                          as you texture your level. The example
                          shaders will work best if you initially
                          unzip the textures in their respective
                          folders under baseq3/textures/ . For
                          example, ik2k_wood_*.zip goes to folder
                          baseq3/textures/ik2k_wood/ . However, when
                          you're about to release your level you
                          should make sure it's loading all of its
                          textures from your own folder.

                          The only exception is the environment map.
                          It should always be placed in baseq3/env/

                          NOTE: a sky shader that uses the lake
                          environment map is included in ik2k_misc.

*** This model was downloaded at: http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/max-battle-axe/231341

*** It is subject to the following license agreement:

End User And Seller Agreement

Turbo Squid, Inc. and its affiliates and related companies (collectively "TurboSquid"), operate turbosquid.com and gamasutraexchange.com (each referred to as "Website"). The terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between TurboSquid and you ("You" or "Your") regarding the terms on which TurboSquid offers You access to its Website and Service. Your use of the Website or Service constitutes acceptance of these Terms.

I. DEFINITIONS

1. "Client Application" refers to TurboSquid software available for download at the TurboSquid web site or any other authorized download site, which allows Members to browse, purchase, upload, and download all Content published at TurboSquid. Client Application also refers to any software application that allows Members to download, purchase, create, alter or otherwise modify Content for use within a video game.

2. "Content" refers to any material published at TurboSquid including but not limited to wire files, models, textures, plug-ins, video games, video game modifications, motion files, collections, packages, materials, scripts, shapes, custom UI skins, tutorials, frequently asked questions, words, music, films, images, and software.

3. "For Sale" includes all Content that requires a purchase of license rights, as distinguished from Content available for free download.

4. "Incorporated Content" refers to Content that cannot be extracted from an application or product and used as stand-alone Content without the use of reverse engineering tools or techniques. For avoidance of doubt, Incorporated Content is the use of Content that is not intended to allow further distribution of the Content outside of the application or product containing the Incorporated Content.

5. "Member" refers to any person who creates a user account at TurboSquid.

6. "Service" refers to transmission, license, or purchase of Content to and from TurboSquid via the TurboSquid Website, a Client Application, or any approved web portal either currently in existence or in the future.

7. "Valid Sale" refers to a sale of license rights in Content or other property via TurboSquid, where the appropriate share of proceeds is received by a Seller who published the Content. Content For Sale via TurboSquid which is returned is not an example of a Valid Sale.

8. "Seller" refers to the submitting individual or business who publishes Content at TurboSquid.

II. LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN SELLER AND MEMBER

A. License Grant for transmission of Content from Seller to Member

For any transmission of Content from a Seller to another Member, whether the transmission was the result of a license or free download, the following terms apply unless more restrictive terms are specified in the text description of the Content in compliance with the requirements for providing more restrictive terms set-forth below:

1. Ownership.

Unless explicitly provided for by a separate agreement, which separate agreement must be available to the Member and which must be subject to acceptance by Member before or at the point of sale, the Seller retains, subject to any license agreement between the Seller and TurboSquid, copyright in Content purchased or downloaded by any Member via TurboSquid. In using the TurboSquid systems, You agree that any additional EULA, license or Seller requirements inserted into Seller products that fail to inform clients of restrictions prior to purchase are invalid, void ab initio, and without effect as they relate to those purchases.

2. Valid License.

Any license rights relating to Content For Sale via TurboSquid are contingent upon the transfer of money from the Member to the Seller. All license rights terminate immediately and without notice if a sale is reversed for any reason.

3. Rights Granted.

For any Sellers who provide TurboSquid with any type of Content for free distribution or sale, the following terms apply:

Seller hereby grants to TurboSquid, and by the act of delivering Content to us, grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, license in any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, set prices for, sell, and distribute net proceeds from any sale, in whole or in part on Seller’s behalf; and to publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; (b) create and use samples of the Content for the purpose of demonstrating or promoting Seller products or services or those of TurboSquid; (c) use any trademarks, service marks or trade names incorporated in the Content in connection with Seller material; and (d) use the name and likeness of any individuals represented in the Content only in connection with Your material.

The Seller grants to the Member who either purchases license rights to Content via a Valid Sale, or downloads freely available Content submitted by the Seller, a non-exclusive, worldwide, license in any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, post, promote, license, sell, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; (b) use any trademarks, service marks or trade names incorporated in the Content in connection with Seller material; and (c) use the name and likeness of any individuals represented in the Content only in connection with Your material. The Member license to Content in this paragraph is limited to Incorporated Content. Such use or republication, including sale or distribution of Content that is not Incorporated Content is prohibited. For illustration, approved distribution or use of Content as Incorporated Content includes, but is not limited to:

(i) As rendered still images or moving images; resold as part of a feature film, broadcast, or stock photography.

(ii) As part of a game if the Content is contained inside a proprietary format and displays inside the game during play.

(iii) As Content published within a book, poster, t-shirt or other item.

(iv) As part of a physical object such as a toy, doll, or model.

4. Rights Not Granted.

Absent a written grant of rights greater than that contained in paragraph 3 above, all other rights or sub-divisions of rights generally included in copyright are excluded from this license and remain the property of Seller.

5. Resale.

The resale or redistribution by the Member of any Content obtained from TurboSquid, whether For Sale or freely available for download, whether part of a Valid Sale or not, is expressly prohibited unless it is Incorporated Content as licensed above.

6. Returned Content.

In the event a Member returns any Content, whether acquired by Valid Sale or freely available for download, all license rights granted herein terminate and the Member must immediately destroy any and all copies contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the Member.

B. GENERAL TERMS

In addition to the above terms that apply to certain contexts, the following terms apply to all types of Content.

1. Ownership.

Seller retains ownership of the copyrights and all other rights in Seller Content, subject to the non-exclusive rights granted to us under this agreement. Seller is free to grant similar rights to others during and after the term of this agreement.

2. Termination.

The license grant contained in this agreement can be terminated using the guidelines below. TurboSquid reserves the right, notwithstanding the guidelines below, to terminate this agreement at any time and without notice if any Content submitted violates the representations and warranties of paragraph three (3) below. This agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon written notice via email or regular mail. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to mean that a Seller may not submit or delete Content from the material submitted by such Seller as part of general maintenance of such Seller’s account.

3. Representations and Warranties.

Seller represents and warrants that: (a) the Content is Your original work, and contains no copyrighted material of any kind that Seller is not the exclusive owner of, including but not limited to: music and/or synchronization rights, images (moving or still) of any kind, writings of any kind, and model clearances/releases; (b) Seller has full right and power to enter into and perform this agreement, and have secured all third party consents necessary to enter into this agreement; (c) the Content does not and will not infringe on any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or moral rights; (d) the Content does not and will not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (e) the Content is not and will not be defamatory, libelous, pornographic, obscene or evocative of racial hatred of any kind; (f) the Content does not and will not contain any viruses or other programming routines that detrimentally interfere with computer systems or data; (g) the Content does not contain any material that, as a condition of use, requires additional license restrictions such as requiring the publication of source code or Content that limits commercial exploitation of Incorporated Content; and (h) all factual assertions that Seller has made and will make to us are true and complete. Seller agrees to execute and deliver documents to us, upon our reasonable request, that evidence or effectuate our rights under this agreement.

4. Determining Type of Content.

TurboSquid implements and maintains business practices which enable us to accurately categorize Content that Sellers deliver to us. If TurboSquid makes an error in good faith, however and consequently exceed our license rights, Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy will be for us to take all reasonable steps to promptly correct the error as soon as TurboSquid become aware of the error.

5. Royalty Payments & Commission.

Seller will be entitled to a royalty of 50% (unless otherwise specified) of all proceeds from the Valid Sale of Seller’s Content paid by check monthly. The remaining 50% of all proceeds from Valid Sale’s is deducted by TurboSquid as a commission. Seller hereby authorizes TurboSquid to collect and distribute such royalties and commissions.

III. GENERAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL MEMBERS, SELLERS, AND OTHER PARTIES USING TURBOSQUID IN ANY WAY

1. INDEMNITY.

You agree to indemnify and hold TurboSquid and its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, alliance members, other partners, employees and representatives ("TurboSquid Parties") harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to, or arising out of Your Content, Your use of or connection to the Website (including any use by You on behalf of Your employer), Your use of the TurboSquid Client Application, Your violation of the Terms, or Your violation of any rights of another.
