warzone2100 (2.1.0~0.svn3330-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot
    - Breaks compatibility with r3260 savegames and netcode
  * Kill a bogus EOF. Upstream said: That code FUBAR (Closes: #458733)
  * Improve the data package description - it is data, not the game

warzone2100 (2.1.0~0.svn3260-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag upload
  * Don't attempt to build/install the data in binary-arch (Closes: #458526)
  * Disable debug because that turns compiler warnings into errors
  * Specifically use automake 1.10 since automake 1.9 is a higher priority in
    the alternatives for automake and we need automake 1.10 or greater.
