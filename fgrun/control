Description: graphical frontend for running FlightGear
 FlightGear Launch Control (FGRun) is a graphical frontend for running the
 FlightGear Flight Simulator (fgfs). 
 .
 It includes the ability to configure your scenery paths FlightGear setup. 
 When selecting an aircraft you are able to view a complete 3d model and see
 its development status and author. When selecting an airport or carrier to 
 launch from you can chose either by the ICAO ID (International Civilian 
 Aviation Organisation Identifier) or the airport id, with the flexibility of 
 selecting a runway and parking position also. 
 .
 When launching the simulation FGRun includes a comprehensive configuration 
 system, allowing you to directly configure settings such as screen resolution
 and multiplayer settings. 
 .
 FGRun also includes support for TerraSync, a tool included with FlightGear 
 that allows you to download and use scenery while in the simulation, it can
 also preload the scenery for your selected location as the airport selection
 screen.
